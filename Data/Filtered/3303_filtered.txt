By Very angry girl from Palm Beach, FL Comments about HP 15.6" AMD Quad-Core Laptop Computer: I bought this laptop for my birthday present and when I got it I was completely in love it with it for about the first 5 days. Afterwards, it started saying I lost connection and therefore, I couldn't use the Internet. So, I restarted the laptop and all of a sudden,it began to be unresponsive, slow, and the touchscreen feature(which was very helpful) did not work anymore. I'm really disappointed because before purchasing the laptop I read really good reviews from different websites. But, oh well.
