Along with everyday computing, it's great for photo & video editing, working on the go, business use, and multimedia. Premium portable computing The Zenbook UX305 is just 12.3 mm thick and weighs a mere 1.2 kg, making it one of the slimmest laptops in the world. Despite its size, it isn't at all fragile thanks to the all-aluminium construction. Plus, the premium spun cover gives a discreet and refined look that fits into any professional situation. All-new Intel® technology One of the reasons the Zenbook UX305 is so thin is that it's powered by the new 6th generation Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't require large cooling fans, so can be intelligently placed inside the chassis to completely maximise space. The Core™ M is designed to deliver power when you need it and efficiency when you don't, so you can enjoy high performance computing when working and a longer battery life when simply browsing the web or chatting to friends. Cutting-edge storage On-board file storage comes courtesy of a solid-state drive (SSD). Much smaller and faster than a regular hard drive, an SSD speeds up booting, loading and helps deliver smooth computing from the second you turn on. High definition media From quickly editing a photo to streaming HD films, you can expect beautifully detailed visuals thanks to the QHD+ screen with an impeccable 3200 x 1800 resolution. Bang & Olufsen ICEpower audio makes sure your films and music sound great, whether you're listening through via headphones or the built-in speakers. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Beautifully designed and built from premium materials, the Asus Zenbook UX305 13.3” Laptop is ideal for high-end computing on the go. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Along with everyday computing, it's great for photo & video editing, working on the go, business use, and multimedia. Premium portable computing The Zenbook UX305 is just 12.3 mm thick and weighs a mere 1.2 kg, making it one of the slimmest laptops in the world. Despite its size, it isn't at all fragile thanks to the all-aluminium construction. Plus, the premium spun cover gives a discreet and refined look that fits into any professional situation. All-new Intel® technology One of the reasons the Zenbook UX305 is so thin is that it's powered by the new 6th generation Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't require large cooling fans, so can be intelligently placed inside the chassis to completely maximise space. The Core™ M is designed to deliver power when you need it and efficiency when you don't, so you can enjoy high performance computing when working and a longer battery life when simply browsing the web or chatting to friends. Cutting-edge storage On-board file storage comes courtesy of a solid-state drive (SSD). Much smaller and faster than a regular hard drive, an SSD speeds up booting, loading and helps deliver smooth computing from the second you turn on. High definition media From quickly editing a photo to streaming HD films, you can expect beautifully detailed visuals thanks to the QHD+ screen with an impeccable 3200 x 1800 resolution. Bang & Olufsen ICEpower audio makes sure your films and music sound great, whether you're listening through via headphones or the built-in speakers. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Beautifully designed and built from premium materials, the Asus Zenbook UX305 13.3” Laptop is ideal for high-end computing on the go. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Bundles 2 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Highlights - One of the slimmest and lightest 13.3” laptops in the world - Premium all-aluminium construction - Intel® Core™ M processing delivers great performance without compromising battery life - Full HD screen makes for highly-detailed films, games and everyday browsing Style This laptop is part of our Style range, which has beautifully-crafted premium PCs designed to impress. Along with everyday computing, it's great for photo & video editing, working on the go, business use, and multimedia. Premium portable computing The Zenbook UX305 is just 12.3 mm thick and weighs a mere 1.2 kg, making it one of the slimmest laptops in the world. Despite its size, it isn't at all fragile thanks to the all-aluminium construction. Plus, the premium spun cover gives a discreet and refined look that fits into any professional situation. All-new Intel® technology One of the reasons the Zenbook UX305 is so thin is that it's powered by the new 6th generation Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't require large cooling fans, so can be intelligently placed inside the chassis to completely maximise space. The Core™ M is designed to deliver power when you need it and efficiency when you don't, so you can enjoy high performance computing when working and a longer battery life when simply browsing the web or chatting to friends. Cutting-edge storage On-board file storage comes courtesy of a solid-state drive (SSD). Much smaller and faster than a regular hard drive, an SSD speeds up booting, loading and helps deliver smooth computing from the second you turn on. High definition media From quickly editing a photo to streaming HD films, you can expect beautifully detailed visuals thanks to the QHD+ screen with an impeccable 3200 x 1800 resolution. Bang & Olufsen ICEpower audio makes sure your films and music sound great, whether you're listening through via headphones or the built-in speakers. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking.

Product information Highlights - One of the slimmest and lightest 13.3” laptops in the world - Premium all-aluminium construction - Intel® Core™ M processing delivers great performance without compromising battery life - Full HD screen makes for highly-detailed films, games and everyday browsing Style This laptop is part of our Style range, which has beautifully-crafted premium PCs designed to impress. Along with everyday computing, it's great for photo & video editing, working on the go, business use, and multimedia. Premium portable computing The Zenbook UX305 is just 12.3 mm thick and weighs a mere 1.2 kg, making it one of the slimmest laptops in the world. Despite its size, it isn't at all fragile thanks to the all-aluminium construction. Plus, the premium spun cover gives a discreet and refined look that fits into any professional situation. All-new Intel® technology One of the reasons the Zenbook UX305 is so thin is that it's powered by the new 6th generation Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't require large cooling fans, so can be intelligently placed inside the chassis to completely maximise space. The Core™ M is designed to deliver power when you need it and efficiency when you don't, so you can enjoy high performance computing when working and a longer battery life when simply browsing the web or chatting to friends. Cutting-edge storage On-board file storage comes courtesy of a solid-state drive (SSD). Much smaller and faster than a regular hard drive, an SSD speeds up booting, loading and helps deliver smooth computing from the second you turn on. High definition media From quickly editing a photo to streaming HD films, you can expect beautifully detailed visuals thanks to the QHD+ screen with an impeccable 3200 x 1800 resolution. Bang & Olufsen ICEpower audio makes sure your films and music sound great, whether you're listening through via headphones or the built-in speakers. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Beautifully designed and built from premium materials, the Asus Zenbook UX305 13.3” Laptop is ideal for high-end computing on the go.
