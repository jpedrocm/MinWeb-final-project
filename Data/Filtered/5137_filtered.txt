Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by murphj Awesome 2-in-1 Brilliant design, incredible functionality. The m7 proc is plenty of power. 8 GB ram and 256 GB SSD provide plenty of room to do real work. Easy to use on the lap. Battery life good to very good (only I want GREAT). 4G LTE is good, but had to open a Verizon account. AT&T needs this product. The mobility aspect is a must for me and this thing has it all. I can read the news in the morning, use it at the office with huge monitor etc. (I don't but I could), and then use it for brief notes, reactive work while I watch TV at night. It's a huge win for HP. Keep it up. August 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by grabhammer Good sturdy tablet Purchased as a work laptop for a home office. Durable. Light. Fits in a purse. Good wireless. Decent keyboard. Good pen. Optional 4G is a nice feature for traveling workers (e.g., airports). Reasonable graphics performance. Does not overheat. Very reasonable battery life. Have had no issues with firmware, drivers, or updates. Recommend carrying a USB port expander and display adapters like USB-C to DVI, USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to display port. June 15, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Scott64 Nice but not what I expected The device is heavily promoted on the website, but it doesn't really live up to being a replacement for a laptop. The Bang & Olufsen sound is not good. I probably should not have expected much from the 4 tiny speakers. There are no significant accessories available. All of the accessories work on the Elite X2 but do not work on the Spectre x2. The USB-C ports require an adaptor. The Wireless works very well as does the Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life has not been great, but still working on minimizing features to save battery. Overall, it is an expensive toy that was well marketed. May 27, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lemonade Nice packaging, complete failure How I would love to be writing something completely different. I had high hopes for this computer: an alternative to the Surface Pro that comes with a beautiful design and solid keyboard. Unfortunately, I was mailed three machines in a row that failed. The first had a non-working keyboard. The second failed after a month, refusing to start, completely black screen. If HP's telephone tree was easier to climb, perhaps I would have been more patient to try again, but after the third machine came with a tampered box and they insisted it was new, but upon opening it was yet another dead, non-working machine, I gave up. All I can say is if you do take a chance, make sure you are using OneDrive or risk losing everything. These "tablet" computers have no access to hard drive. May 16, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by MSTRET Exceptional speed, much sturdier than surface pro4 I bought 2 spectre X2's, one for each daughter as a xmas present. Each has 500GB ,m7 core processor, 8GB RAM, 1920x1280 display. They are sturdy, fast, and can definitely replace a laptop. Metal kickstand and Metal keyboard make this much sturdier and more elegant than surface pro 4 yet the cost of spectre x 2 is a fraction of a similar spec Surface Pro 4 , making the spectre x2 even more appealing. Spectre x2 has 2 USB-C ports and comes with one USB-C to USB-A dongle standardly in the box. If you pay the extra $30.00 for an extra dongle, you should receive 2 dongles, Unfortunately I paid the extra $30.00 for each Spectre x2 but I only got one dongle per computer. I contacted HP customer service and they have been very kind but I'm still waiting for the dongles I paid $30.00 for to be shipped. Overall great product.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by murphj Awesome 2-in-1 Brilliant design, incredible functionality. The m7 proc is plenty of power. 8 GB ram and 256 GB SSD provide plenty of room to do real work. Easy to use on the lap. Battery life good to very good (only I want GREAT). 4G LTE is good, but had to open a Verizon account. AT&T needs this product. The mobility aspect is a must for me and this thing has it all. I can read the news in the morning, use it at the office with huge monitor etc. (I don't but I could), and then use it for brief notes, reactive work while I watch TV at night. It's a huge win for HP. Keep it up. August 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by grabhammer Good sturdy tablet Purchased as a work laptop for a home office. Durable. Light. Fits in a purse. Good wireless. Decent keyboard. Good pen. Optional 4G is a nice feature for traveling workers (e.g., airports). Reasonable graphics performance. Does not overheat. Very reasonable battery life. Have had no issues with firmware, drivers, or updates. Recommend carrying a USB port expander and display adapters like USB-C to DVI, USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to display port. June 15, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Scott64 Nice but not what I expected The device is heavily promoted on the website, but it doesn't really live up to being a replacement for a laptop. The Bang & Olufsen sound is not good. I probably should not have expected much from the 4 tiny speakers. There are no significant accessories available. All of the accessories work on the Elite X2 but do not work on the Spectre x2. The USB-C ports require an adaptor. The Wireless works very well as does the Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life has not been great, but still working on minimizing features to save battery. Overall, it is an expensive toy that was well marketed. May 27, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lemonade Nice packaging, complete failure How I would love to be writing something completely different. I had high hopes for this computer: an alternative to the Surface Pro that comes with a beautiful design and solid keyboard. Unfortunately, I was mailed three machines in a row that failed. The first had a non-working keyboard. The second failed after a month, refusing to start, completely black screen. If HP's telephone tree was easier to climb, perhaps I would have been more patient to try again, but after the third machine came with a tampered box and they insisted it was new, but upon opening it was yet another dead, non-working machine, I gave up. All I can say is if you do take a chance, make sure you are using OneDrive or risk losing everything. These "tablet" computers have no access to hard drive. May 16, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by MSTRET Exceptional speed, much sturdier than surface pro4 I bought 2 spectre X2's, one for each daughter as a xmas present. Each has 500GB ,m7 core processor, 8GB RAM, 1920x1280 display. They are sturdy, fast, and can definitely replace a laptop. Metal kickstand and Metal keyboard make this much sturdier and more elegant than surface pro 4 yet the cost of spectre x 2 is a fraction of a similar spec Surface Pro 4 , making the spectre x2 even more appealing. Spectre x2 has 2 USB-C ports and comes with one USB-C to USB-A dongle standardly in the box. If you pay the extra $30.00 for an extra dongle, you should receive 2 dongles, Unfortunately I paid the extra $30.00 for each Spectre x2 but I only got one dongle per computer. I contacted HP customer service and they have been very kind but I'm still waiting for the dongles I paid $30.00 for to be shipped. Overall great product.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by murphj Awesome 2-in-1 Brilliant design, incredible functionality. The m7 proc is plenty of power. 8 GB ram and 256 GB SSD provide plenty of room to do real work. Easy to use on the lap. Battery life good to very good (only I want GREAT). 4G LTE is good, but had to open a Verizon account. AT&T needs this product. The mobility aspect is a must for me and this thing has it all. I can read the news in the morning, use it at the office with huge monitor etc. (I don't but I could), and then use it for brief notes, reactive work while I watch TV at night. It's a huge win for HP. Keep it up. August 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by grabhammer Good sturdy tablet Purchased as a work laptop for a home office. Durable. Light. Fits in a purse. Good wireless. Decent keyboard. Good pen. Optional 4G is a nice feature for traveling workers (e.g., airports). Reasonable graphics performance. Does not overheat. Very reasonable battery life. Have had no issues with firmware, drivers, or updates. Recommend carrying a USB port expander and display adapters like USB-C to DVI, USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to display port. June 15, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Scott64 Nice but not what I expected The device is heavily promoted on the website, but it doesn't really live up to being a replacement for a laptop. The Bang & Olufsen sound is not good. I probably should not have expected much from the 4 tiny speakers. There are no significant accessories available. All of the accessories work on the Elite X2 but do not work on the Spectre x2. The USB-C ports require an adaptor. The Wireless works very well as does the Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life has not been great, but still working on minimizing features to save battery. Overall, it is an expensive toy that was well marketed. May 27, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lemonade Nice packaging, complete failure How I would love to be writing something completely different. I had high hopes for this computer: an alternative to the Surface Pro that comes with a beautiful design and solid keyboard. Unfortunately, I was mailed three machines in a row that failed. The first had a non-working keyboard. The second failed after a month, refusing to start, completely black screen. If HP's telephone tree was easier to climb, perhaps I would have been more patient to try again, but after the third machine came with a tampered box and they insisted it was new, but upon opening it was yet another dead, non-working machine, I gave up. All I can say is if you do take a chance, make sure you are using OneDrive or risk losing everything. These "tablet" computers have no access to hard drive. May 16, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by MSTRET Exceptional speed, much sturdier than surface pro4 I bought 2 spectre X2's, one for each daughter as a xmas present. Each has 500GB ,m7 core processor, 8GB RAM, 1920x1280 display. They are sturdy, fast, and can definitely replace a laptop. Metal kickstand and Metal keyboard make this much sturdier and more elegant than surface pro 4 yet the cost of spectre x 2 is a fraction of a similar spec Surface Pro 4 , making the spectre x2 even more appealing. Spectre x2 has 2 USB-C ports and comes with one USB-C to USB-A dongle standardly in the box. If you pay the extra $30.00 for an extra dongle, you should receive 2 dongles, Unfortunately I paid the extra $30.00 for each Spectre x2 but I only got one dongle per computer. I contacted HP customer service and they have been very kind but I'm still waiting for the dongles I paid $30.00 for to be shipped. Overall great product.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by murphj Awesome 2-in-1 Brilliant design, incredible functionality. The m7 proc is plenty of power. 8 GB ram and 256 GB SSD provide plenty of room to do real work. Easy to use on the lap. Battery life good to very good (only I want GREAT). 4G LTE is good, but had to open a Verizon account. AT&T needs this product. The mobility aspect is a must for me and this thing has it all. I can read the news in the morning, use it at the office with huge monitor etc. (I don't but I could), and then use it for brief notes, reactive work while I watch TV at night. It's a huge win for HP. Keep it up. August 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by grabhammer Good sturdy tablet Purchased as a work laptop for a home office. Durable. Light. Fits in a purse. Good wireless. Decent keyboard. Good pen. Optional 4G is a nice feature for traveling workers (e.g., airports). Reasonable graphics performance. Does not overheat. Very reasonable battery life. Have had no issues with firmware, drivers, or updates. Recommend carrying a USB port expander and display adapters like USB-C to DVI, USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to display port. June 15, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Scott64 Nice but not what I expected The device is heavily promoted on the website, but it doesn't really live up to being a replacement for a laptop. The Bang & Olufsen sound is not good. I probably should not have expected much from the 4 tiny speakers. There are no significant accessories available. All of the accessories work on the Elite X2 but do not work on the Spectre x2. The USB-C ports require an adaptor. The Wireless works very well as does the Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life has not been great, but still working on minimizing features to save battery. Overall, it is an expensive toy that was well marketed. May 27, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lemonade Nice packaging, complete failure How I would love to be writing something completely different. I had high hopes for this computer: an alternative to the Surface Pro that comes with a beautiful design and solid keyboard. Unfortunately, I was mailed three machines in a row that failed. The first had a non-working keyboard. The second failed after a month, refusing to start, completely black screen. If HP's telephone tree was easier to climb, perhaps I would have been more patient to try again, but after the third machine came with a tampered box and they insisted it was new, but upon opening it was yet another dead, non-working machine, I gave up. All I can say is if you do take a chance, make sure you are using OneDrive or risk losing everything. These "tablet" computers have no access to hard drive. May 16, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by MSTRET Exceptional speed, much sturdier than surface pro4 I bought 2 spectre X2's, one for each daughter as a xmas present. Each has 500GB ,m7 core processor, 8GB RAM, 1920x1280 display. They are sturdy, fast, and can definitely replace a laptop. Metal kickstand and Metal keyboard make this much sturdier and more elegant than surface pro 4 yet the cost of spectre x 2 is a fraction of a similar spec Surface Pro 4 , making the spectre x2 even more appealing. Spectre x2 has 2 USB-C ports and comes with one USB-C to USB-A dongle standardly in the box. If you pay the extra $30.00 for an extra dongle, you should receive 2 dongles, Unfortunately I paid the extra $30.00 for each Spectre x2 but I only got one dongle per computer. I contacted HP customer service and they have been very kind but I'm still waiting for the dongles I paid $30.00 for to be shipped. Overall great product.

I can read the news in the morning, use it at the office with huge monitor etc. (I don't but I could), and then use it for brief notes, reactive work while I watch TV at night. It's a huge win for HP. Keep it up. August 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by grabhammer Good sturdy tablet Purchased as a work laptop for a home office. Durable. Light. Fits in a purse. Good wireless. Decent keyboard. Good pen. Optional 4G is a nice feature for traveling workers (e.g., airports). Reasonable graphics performance. Does not overheat. Very reasonable battery life. Have had no issues with firmware, drivers, or updates. Recommend carrying a USB port expander and display adapters like USB-C to DVI, USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to display port. June 15, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Scott64 Nice but not what I expected The device is heavily promoted on the website, but it doesn't really live up to being a replacement for a laptop. The Bang & Olufsen sound is not good. I probably should not have expected much from the 4 tiny speakers. There are no significant accessories available. All of the accessories work on the Elite X2 but do not work on the Spectre x2. The USB-C ports require an adaptor. The Wireless works very well as does the Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life has not been great, but still working on minimizing features to save battery. Overall, it is an expensive toy that was well marketed. May 27, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lemonade Nice packaging, complete failure How I would love to be writing something completely different. I had high hopes for this computer: an alternative to the Surface Pro that comes with a beautiful design and solid keyboard. Unfortunately, I was mailed three machines in a row that failed. The first had a non-working keyboard. The second failed after a month, refusing to start, completely black screen. If HP's telephone tree was easier to climb, perhaps I would have been more patient to try again, but after the third machine came with a tampered box and they insisted it was new, but upon opening it was yet another dead, non-working machine, I gave up. All I can say is if you do take a chance, make sure you are using OneDrive or risk losing everything. These "tablet" computers have no access to hard drive. May 16, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by MSTRET Exceptional speed, much sturdier than surface pro4 I bought 2 spectre X2's, one for each daughter as a xmas present. Each has 500GB ,m7 core processor, 8GB RAM, 1920x1280 display. They are sturdy, fast, and can definitely replace a laptop. Metal kickstand and Metal keyboard make this much sturdier and more elegant than surface pro 4 yet the cost of spectre x 2 is a fraction of a similar spec Surface Pro 4 , making the spectre x2 even more appealing. Spectre x2 has 2 USB-C ports and comes with one USB-C to USB-A dongle standardly in the box. If you pay the extra $30.00 for an extra dongle, you should receive 2 dongles, Unfortunately I paid the extra $30.00 for each Spectre x2 but I only got one dongle per computer. I contacted HP customer service and they have been very kind but I'm still waiting for the dongles I paid $30.00 for to be shipped. Overall great product. January 13, 2016 2016-10-16 bvseo-cps-pl-PRR
