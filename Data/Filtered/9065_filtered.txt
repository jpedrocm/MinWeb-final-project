On the keyboard how do you make your Capitals letters to work? All I got instruction setup and warranty and not showing anything about it. Please tell me because I don't see a key with it on it. Thanks. Asked by: StarMaster To enable or disable caps lock on your Chromebook press: alt + search. You can also set the search key function permanently to function as caps lock, ctrl, alt, escape, or even disable it all together. To change the function visit your Chromebook's settings page (chrome://settings) and click Keyboard Settings.

Rated 5 out of 5 by HumanMan from Love it This is probably the best deal out there for a laptop right now. Check out the specs, and then compare the cost of these specs on other machines. I use this for personal and work purposes. It's very versatile as a portable computer. the size is great, big enough to forget your're looking at a small screen, but small enough to carry it around inside a padded zipper binder. When I first booted up, I couldn't sign in. I went to the settings and had it check for an update. It downloaded and installed, then everything worked great. That was the first and only issue I've had with this machine. The updates are otherwise unnoticed. Date published: 2016-03-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by bradford_usa from Great little machine I just got the 100S Chromebook a few days ago (on sale at best buy). I really like it. The build quality feels great as does the keyboard. It weighs next to nothing and the battery life is exceptional. Since it's a chromebook, the functionality is not the same as windows, but for my purposes -- internet, word processing, and watching videos, this machine is great. Except for the speakers, which are not great. For the price, this was an amazing deal. Date published: 2016-02-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Jessti from Extremely Pleased When I heard Lenovo was going to give Chrome OS some love I could not wait to get my hands on this product. There are no cons for this Chromebook. Great battery, charges quickly. I'm an IT technician and bring this along on service calls for an awesome assistant for emailing, research and communication. This somehow makes me an even larger Google fan. Build quality feels very good.

Hi I just got one of your chromebooks. On the keyboard how do you make your Capitals letters to work? All I got instruction setup and warranty and not showing anything about it. Please tell me because I don't see a key with it on it. Thanks. Asked by: StarMaster To enable or disable caps lock on your Chromebook press: alt + search. You can also set the search key function permanently to function as caps lock, ctrl, alt, escape, or even disable it all together. To change the function visit your Chromebook's settings page (chrome://settings) and click Keyboard Settings. Answered by: noproblem Date published: 2016-05-05 Does this model have the backlit keyboard & also does it not have the left click to open opitions  Asked by: dawgsfan3481 NOT the keyboard,what do you expect for this kind of price? Answered by: mr wolf Date published: 2016-07-17 Interested in your Chromebook for my Jr. in high school. He has no computer. He needs it for school purposes not gaming or movies.
