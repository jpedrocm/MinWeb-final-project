Eluktronics has received numerous requests for a "barebones" PC for those who like to customize on their own and are happy to offer this exclusive* configuration to Newegg customers. Thie P650RP6 is a new refresh of Eluktronics best selling pro series gaming laptop which is now powered by the NVIDIA Pascal™ architecture.
