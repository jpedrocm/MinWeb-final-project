Step up to the next level in technology with the latest iteration of Eluktronics premium gaming laptop. The PRO15RE3 offers near equal performance to a gaming desktop with just as many ports and expandability options while packed in an incredibly thin form factor. An unheard of 64GB DDR4 memory option will have you rendering and multitasking for days on end. Whether you're gaming, working or both, this PC offers a sleek and sophisticated design which doesn't scream "look at me!" in the process. Many PC manufacturers have taken a step back year after year to offer a cheaper product. Running an operating system off of a 5400RPM hard drive with a Core i7 processor is the equivalent of installing a 4-cylinder engine in an exotic sports car. Let's change the game, literally!
