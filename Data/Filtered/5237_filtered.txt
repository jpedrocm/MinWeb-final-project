That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by Tio12 Good, but not all I'd hoped. Screen resolution is fantastic and the touch screen works well on some programs, but not so well on others. An issue for me is the location of the touch pad, which is conveniently large, but as I type, I sometimes touch it with the heel of my hand, sending the cursor to who knows where in the document. It might be my typing techniques, but I do tend to rest the heel of my hands on the computer as I type. Perhaps a smaller touch pad would help. Finally, while the computer is elegantly slim, it is heavier than I anticipated. I purchased it because I was tired of the limitations of my iPad, and it certainly has the features that I missed on the iPad, but it lacks that elegance in design and function that the iPad has. That said, I won't be going back to the iPad. September 27, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Manzo Ranks low among the laptops that I have had This product has a good amount of memory, but for some reason, I have memory issues. I work with a lot of windows and will often get a blue screen of death due to low memory when I have many windows open. I am having resolution setting issues. Either some applications have small font or a web browser is too large. Very small objects fall within the cracks of keys on the keyboard making keys difficult to depress. After 6 months, my battery does not last 2 hours. September 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by CraigH1 Great laptop! There is no laptop I'd rather have! The Spectre x360 15T was the first laptop I could find that met my requirements. I ordered and got it right around the time it was released. I've had it for six months now and am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy it again. It was hard to find what I was looking for. I wanted the following features: - 15.6" display ~200 pixels per inch or less but higher resolution than 1080p. I work with remote consoles that do not scale and wanted to be able to see two at a time (they're often 1024x768) without scrolling and still have the text be readable. So my idea display would be 2560x1440 on a 15.6" display. That gives me a 188ppi which is usable without scaling for me. - At least an i5 CPU -16GB of RAM for running Virtual Machines - More power than the standard integrated graphics, not for gaming but just so it wouldn't get bogged down with the extra pixels at QuadHD resolution or higher. -Great battery life (rated for something more than 8 hours) -More of a want than a need at the time but I was looking for a 2 in 1 device. This is the configuration I got: - 15.6" UltraHD 3840x2160 display, I run it at QuadHD 2560x1440 (I needed to add this as a custom resolution which was easy to do with the built-in Intel software) - i7 6560 CPU, I got this because it has the Iris 540 Graphics which is quite a bit more powerful than the standard Intel HD 520, another item on my checklist. - 16GB of RAM - 512GB SSD, performance is excellent though now they offer it with a 1TB PCIe attached SSD. I would take that instead because it's PCIe and also because it's higher capacity. I don't really need the extra performance now. This thing is fast! It's thin, light, fast, and looks great. Lots of people give me positive comments on the look I think most are surprised, probably expecting it's a Mac or something. I'm actually not a fan of metal and glass on mobile devices. Hopefully the display doesn't break. I don't like metal because it interferes with radio signals. Sure, they place the antenna's behind plastic and do things to reduce the impact but there will be impact/signal reduction. Everyone else is doing it and people think "premium devices" need to be metal and glass. Oh well. So far, I haven't noticed signal strength issues so that's good. It actually seems to be very good. Having a back-lit keyboard on a laptop is great! Oddly, I find the keyboard a little hard to read if you have the back-light on in a well lit room. This isn't a problem because you can just turn it off. Just make sure you do that before you think it's too hard to read the keyboard. I also like the feel of the keyboard and the layout of the keys, inverted-T, insert, delete, etc. I wouldn't change the keyboard. The speakers on this thing are amazing! I'm not crazy about audio or anything but my wife and I both notice that the sound is very clear and rich. In fact I hear details in music that I didn't know were there. The volume is good too. I don't know how it compares to other laptops other than the fact that it's louder than any other laptop I've had. The display is great! It's crisp and the colors are rich and accurate as far as I can tell. It works great at 2560x1440 and having that on a laptop is a huge help for me at work! I have two other external displays which I use in addition but when I'm not at my desk I'm not so restricted by my display and even at my desk I can get more on the laptop display since my monitors are only 1080p. I have the desktop scaling set to 100% (no scaling) in Windows. I love having a 2 in 1 touch screen laptop! As a laptop, I rarely use the touch screen. But for flipping through photos or playing some games I will often use my laptop with the keyboard down and display up or as a tablet. I also use the it at my desk, at work, with the keyboard down on my desk and the display up. This puts the display closer to my face to make small text easier to read. This is far more useful and helpful than I thought. It's especially great to have a large touch screen for some of the board games I like to play that are in the Windows Store. Get a touch screen 2 in 1! You'll be glad you did! Also, Windows Ink Workspace in the Windows 10 Anniversary update is great! Make sure you turn that on by right-clicking on the Start bar and choosing "Show Windows Ink Workspace button". This laptop doesn't have a built in RJ-45 network jack. I need that so I got a USB-C attached Gb NIC with three USB 3.0 ports on it. I use that kind of like a docking station. I plug my monitors in directly to the laptop but I plug in one USB-C cable and it gives me my mouse and keyboard (connected by USB) and my physical network connection. It also came in very nice, "premium", for lack of a better word, packaging, and with a very small and travel friendly power adapter, not the normal brick between two cords adapter. Things to be aware of with this laptop: - USB 3.0, not USB 3.1. That means it will max out at 5Gbps, not 10Gbps. - No PCIe attached storage unless you get the 1TB drive - No physical RJ-45 NIC - No Numeric keypad as some 15.6" laptops have None of those are problems for me. I'm very happy with this laptop! Great job HP! August 26, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Wen1019 Only buy HP when u really think u r a lucky one I have to admit it's really a pretty laptop. Even it's pricey, I still bought it... BUT... Only after 4 months, the cursor starts to malfunction. It jumps up and down in the middle of the screen and I can't get control of it. I tried disable the touchpad, disconnect the mouse, use the touchscreen but none of these worked. Called the tech support and the issue is still unsolved. I am soooooo disappointed since I spent so much money on this laptop and I deserve a better and stable performance. I would recommend everyone not to buy it unless you think you are a lucky person. July 24, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by MeghanHP Why not support Thunderbolt 3, and Quad Core. This product is amazing. Including the following things, TouchScreen, 15.6", 360 convertible. But why not support Thunderbolt 3, and Quad Core.

Exceptional battery life To give you the all-day battery life1 you've been waiting for, we started by building a convertible PC with one of the highest capacity batteries in its class. Then we carefully curated our software to prevent battery-hogging apps from running in the background, and we integrated Panel Self Refreshing Technology into the Quad HD and 4K displays to reduce battery drain without dimming the screen. 1Windows 10/ MM14 battery life will vary depending on various factors including product model, configuration, loaded applications, features, use, wireless functionality, and power management settings. The maximum capacity of the battery will naturally decrease with time and usage. See www.bapco.com for additional details. Commanding performance for the power user Revolutionary Wi-Fi We used a next generation 2x2 Wi-Fi antenna to give you faster wireless speeds and positioned it at the top of the display to maximize reception in every mode. Up to 16GB of RAM The Spectre x360 with up to 16GB memory keeps up with you. 6th generation Intel® processors Faster, quieter, and with more features, the 6th generation of Intel® Core™ processors enhance your computing experience like never before.2 The difference is in the details The thoughtfully engineered keyboard with responsive 1.5mm key travel is contoured to your fingers to keep them centered as you type.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by Tio12 Good, but not all I'd hoped. Screen resolution is fantastic and the touch screen works well on some programs, but not so well on others. An issue for me is the location of the touch pad, which is conveniently large, but as I type, I sometimes touch it with the heel of my hand, sending the cursor to who knows where in the document. It might be my typing techniques, but I do tend to rest the heel of my hands on the computer as I type. Perhaps a smaller touch pad would help. Finally, while the computer is elegantly slim, it is heavier than I anticipated. I purchased it because I was tired of the limitations of my iPad, and it certainly has the features that I missed on the iPad, but it lacks that elegance in design and function that the iPad has. That said, I won't be going back to the iPad. September 27, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Manzo Ranks low among the laptops that I have had This product has a good amount of memory, but for some reason, I have memory issues. I work with a lot of windows and will often get a blue screen of death due to low memory when I have many windows open. I am having resolution setting issues. Either some applications have small font or a web browser is too large. Very small objects fall within the cracks of keys on the keyboard making keys difficult to depress. After 6 months, my battery does not last 2 hours. September 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by CraigH1 Great laptop! There is no laptop I'd rather have! The Spectre x360 15T was the first laptop I could find that met my requirements. I ordered and got it right around the time it was released. I've had it for six months now and am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy it again. It was hard to find what I was looking for. I wanted the following features: - 15.6" display ~200 pixels per inch or less but higher resolution than 1080p. I work with remote consoles that do not scale and wanted to be able to see two at a time (they're often 1024x768) without scrolling and still have the text be readable. So my idea display would be 2560x1440 on a 15.6" display. That gives me a 188ppi which is usable without scaling for me. - At least an i5 CPU -16GB of RAM for running Virtual Machines - More power than the standard integrated graphics, not for gaming but just so it wouldn't get bogged down with the extra pixels at QuadHD resolution or higher. -Great battery life (rated for something more than 8 hours) -More of a want than a need at the time but I was looking for a 2 in 1 device. This is the configuration I got: - 15.6" UltraHD 3840x2160 display, I run it at QuadHD 2560x1440 (I needed to add this as a custom resolution which was easy to do with the built-in Intel software) - i7 6560 CPU, I got this because it has the Iris 540 Graphics which is quite a bit more powerful than the standard Intel HD 520, another item on my checklist. - 16GB of RAM - 512GB SSD, performance is excellent though now they offer it with a 1TB PCIe attached SSD. I would take that instead because it's PCIe and also because it's higher capacity. I don't really need the extra performance now. This thing is fast! It's thin, light, fast, and looks great. Lots of people give me positive comments on the look I think most are surprised, probably expecting it's a Mac or something. I'm actually not a fan of metal and glass on mobile devices. Hopefully the display doesn't break. I don't like metal because it interferes with radio signals. Sure, they place the antenna's behind plastic and do things to reduce the impact but there will be impact/signal reduction. Everyone else is doing it and people think "premium devices" need to be metal and glass. Oh well. So far, I haven't noticed signal strength issues so that's good. It actually seems to be very good. Having a back-lit keyboard on a laptop is great! Oddly, I find the keyboard a little hard to read if you have the back-light on in a well lit room. This isn't a problem because you can just turn it off. Just make sure you do that before you think it's too hard to read the keyboard. I also like the feel of the keyboard and the layout of the keys, inverted-T, insert, delete, etc. I wouldn't change the keyboard. The speakers on this thing are amazing! I'm not crazy about audio or anything but my wife and I both notice that the sound is very clear and rich. In fact I hear details in music that I didn't know were there. The volume is good too. I don't know how it compares to other laptops other than the fact that it's louder than any other laptop I've had. The display is great! It's crisp and the colors are rich and accurate as far as I can tell. It works great at 2560x1440 and having that on a laptop is a huge help for me at work! I have two other external displays which I use in addition but when I'm not at my desk I'm not so restricted by my display and even at my desk I can get more on the laptop display since my monitors are only 1080p. I have the desktop scaling set to 100% (no scaling) in Windows. I love having a 2 in 1 touch screen laptop! As a laptop, I rarely use the touch screen. But for flipping through photos or playing some games I will often use my laptop with the keyboard down and display up or as a tablet. I also use the it at my desk, at work, with the keyboard down on my desk and the display up. This puts the display closer to my face to make small text easier to read. This is far more useful and helpful than I thought. It's especially great to have a large touch screen for some of the board games I like to play that are in the Windows Store. Get a touch screen 2 in 1! You'll be glad you did! Also, Windows Ink Workspace in the Windows 10 Anniversary update is great! Make sure you turn that on by right-clicking on the Start bar and choosing "Show Windows Ink Workspace button". This laptop doesn't have a built in RJ-45 network jack. I need that so I got a USB-C attached Gb NIC with three USB 3.0 ports on it. I use that kind of like a docking station. I plug my monitors in directly to the laptop but I plug in one USB-C cable and it gives me my mouse and keyboard (connected by USB) and my physical network connection. It also came in very nice, "premium", for lack of a better word, packaging, and with a very small and travel friendly power adapter, not the normal brick between two cords adapter. Things to be aware of with this laptop: - USB 3.0, not USB 3.1. That means it will max out at 5Gbps, not 10Gbps. - No PCIe attached storage unless you get the 1TB drive - No physical RJ-45 NIC - No Numeric keypad as some 15.6" laptops have None of those are problems for me. I'm very happy with this laptop! Great job HP! August 26, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Wen1019 Only buy HP when u really think u r a lucky one I have to admit it's really a pretty laptop. Even it's pricey, I still bought it... BUT... Only after 4 months, the cursor starts to malfunction. It jumps up and down in the middle of the screen and I can't get control of it. I tried disable the touchpad, disconnect the mouse, use the touchscreen but none of these worked. Called the tech support and the issue is still unsolved. I am soooooo disappointed since I spent so much money on this laptop and I deserve a better and stable performance. I would recommend everyone not to buy it unless you think you are a lucky person.

Exceptional battery life To give you the all-day battery life1 you've been waiting for, we started by building a convertible PC with one of the highest capacity batteries in its class. Then we carefully curated our software to prevent battery-hogging apps from running in the background, and we integrated Panel Self Refreshing Technology into the Quad HD and 4K displays to reduce battery drain without dimming the screen. 1Windows 10/ MM14 battery life will vary depending on various factors including product model, configuration, loaded applications, features, use, wireless functionality, and power management settings.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by Tio12 Good, but not all I'd hoped. Screen resolution is fantastic and the touch screen works well on some programs, but not so well on others. An issue for me is the location of the touch pad, which is conveniently large, but as I type, I sometimes touch it with the heel of my hand, sending the cursor to who knows where in the document. It might be my typing techniques, but I do tend to rest the heel of my hands on the computer as I type. Perhaps a smaller touch pad would help. Finally, while the computer is elegantly slim, it is heavier than I anticipated. I purchased it because I was tired of the limitations of my iPad, and it certainly has the features that I missed on the iPad, but it lacks that elegance in design and function that the iPad has. That said, I won't be going back to the iPad. September 27, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Manzo Ranks low among the laptops that I have had This product has a good amount of memory, but for some reason, I have memory issues. I work with a lot of windows and will often get a blue screen of death due to low memory when I have many windows open. I am having resolution setting issues. Either some applications have small font or a web browser is too large. Very small objects fall within the cracks of keys on the keyboard making keys difficult to depress. After 6 months, my battery does not last 2 hours. September 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by CraigH1 Great laptop! There is no laptop I'd rather have! The Spectre x360 15T was the first laptop I could find that met my requirements. I ordered and got it right around the time it was released. I've had it for six months now and am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy it again. It was hard to find what I was looking for. I wanted the following features: - 15.6" display ~200 pixels per inch or less but higher resolution than 1080p. I work with remote consoles that do not scale and wanted to be able to see two at a time (they're often 1024x768) without scrolling and still have the text be readable. So my idea display would be 2560x1440 on a 15.6" display. That gives me a 188ppi which is usable without scaling for me. - At least an i5 CPU -16GB of RAM for running Virtual Machines - More power than the standard integrated graphics, not for gaming but just so it wouldn't get bogged down with the extra pixels at QuadHD resolution or higher. -Great battery life (rated for something more than 8 hours) -More of a want than a need at the time but I was looking for a 2 in 1 device. This is the configuration I got: - 15.6" UltraHD 3840x2160 display, I run it at QuadHD 2560x1440 (I needed to add this as a custom resolution which was easy to do with the built-in Intel software) - i7 6560 CPU, I got this because it has the Iris 540 Graphics which is quite a bit more powerful than the standard Intel HD 520, another item on my checklist. - 16GB of RAM - 512GB SSD, performance is excellent though now they offer it with a 1TB PCIe attached SSD. I would take that instead because it's PCIe and also because it's higher capacity. I don't really need the extra performance now. This thing is fast! It's thin, light, fast, and looks great. Lots of people give me positive comments on the look I think most are surprised, probably expecting it's a Mac or something. I'm actually not a fan of metal and glass on mobile devices. Hopefully the display doesn't break. I don't like metal because it interferes with radio signals. Sure, they place the antenna's behind plastic and do things to reduce the impact but there will be impact/signal reduction. Everyone else is doing it and people think "premium devices" need to be metal and glass. Oh well. So far, I haven't noticed signal strength issues so that's good. It actually seems to be very good. Having a back-lit keyboard on a laptop is great! Oddly, I find the keyboard a little hard to read if you have the back-light on in a well lit room. This isn't a problem because you can just turn it off. Just make sure you do that before you think it's too hard to read the keyboard. I also like the feel of the keyboard and the layout of the keys, inverted-T, insert, delete, etc. I wouldn't change the keyboard. The speakers on this thing are amazing! I'm not crazy about audio or anything but my wife and I both notice that the sound is very clear and rich. In fact I hear details in music that I didn't know were there. The volume is good too. I don't know how it compares to other laptops other than the fact that it's louder than any other laptop I've had. The display is great! It's crisp and the colors are rich and accurate as far as I can tell. It works great at 2560x1440 and having that on a laptop is a huge help for me at work! I have two other external displays which I use in addition but when I'm not at my desk I'm not so restricted by my display and even at my desk I can get more on the laptop display since my monitors are only 1080p. I have the desktop scaling set to 100% (no scaling) in Windows. I love having a 2 in 1 touch screen laptop! As a laptop, I rarely use the touch screen. But for flipping through photos or playing some games I will often use my laptop with the keyboard down and display up or as a tablet. I also use the it at my desk, at work, with the keyboard down on my desk and the display up. This puts the display closer to my face to make small text easier to read. This is far more useful and helpful than I thought. It's especially great to have a large touch screen for some of the board games I like to play that are in the Windows Store. Get a touch screen 2 in 1! You'll be glad you did! Also, Windows Ink Workspace in the Windows 10 Anniversary update is great! Make sure you turn that on by right-clicking on the Start bar and choosing "Show Windows Ink Workspace button". This laptop doesn't have a built in RJ-45 network jack. I need that so I got a USB-C attached Gb NIC with three USB 3.0 ports on it. I use that kind of like a docking station. I plug my monitors in directly to the laptop but I plug in one USB-C cable and it gives me my mouse and keyboard (connected by USB) and my physical network connection. It also came in very nice, "premium", for lack of a better word, packaging, and with a very small and travel friendly power adapter, not the normal brick between two cords adapter. Things to be aware of with this laptop: - USB 3.0, not USB 3.1. That means it will max out at 5Gbps, not 10Gbps. - No PCIe attached storage unless you get the 1TB drive - No physical RJ-45 NIC - No Numeric keypad as some 15.6" laptops have None of those are problems for me. I'm very happy with this laptop! Great job HP! August 26, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Wen1019 Only buy HP when u really think u r a lucky one I have to admit it's really a pretty laptop. Even it's pricey, I still bought it... BUT... Only after 4 months, the cursor starts to malfunction. It jumps up and down in the middle of the screen and I can't get control of it. I tried disable the touchpad, disconnect the mouse, use the touchscreen but none of these worked. Called the tech support and the issue is still unsolved. I am soooooo disappointed since I spent so much money on this laptop and I deserve a better and stable performance. I would recommend everyone not to buy it unless you think you are a lucky person.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by Tio12 Good, but not all I'd hoped. Screen resolution is fantastic and the touch screen works well on some programs, but not so well on others. An issue for me is the location of the touch pad, which is conveniently large, but as I type, I sometimes touch it with the heel of my hand, sending the cursor to who knows where in the document. It might be my typing techniques, but I do tend to rest the heel of my hands on the computer as I type. Perhaps a smaller touch pad would help. Finally, while the computer is elegantly slim, it is heavier than I anticipated. I purchased it because I was tired of the limitations of my iPad, and it certainly has the features that I missed on the iPad, but it lacks that elegance in design and function that the iPad has. That said, I won't be going back to the iPad. September 27, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Manzo Ranks low among the laptops that I have had This product has a good amount of memory, but for some reason, I have memory issues. I work with a lot of windows and will often get a blue screen of death due to low memory when I have many windows open. I am having resolution setting issues. Either some applications have small font or a web browser is too large. Very small objects fall within the cracks of keys on the keyboard making keys difficult to depress. After 6 months, my battery does not last 2 hours. September 19, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by CraigH1 Great laptop! There is no laptop I'd rather have! The Spectre x360 15T was the first laptop I could find that met my requirements. I ordered and got it right around the time it was released. I've had it for six months now and am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy it again. It was hard to find what I was looking for. I wanted the following features: - 15.6" display ~200 pixels per inch or less but higher resolution than 1080p. I work with remote consoles that do not scale and wanted to be able to see two at a time (they're often 1024x768) without scrolling and still have the text be readable. So my idea display would be 2560x1440 on a 15.6" display. That gives me a 188ppi which is usable without scaling for me. - At least an i5 CPU -16GB of RAM for running Virtual Machines - More power than the standard integrated graphics, not for gaming but just so it wouldn't get bogged down with the extra pixels at QuadHD resolution or higher. -Great battery life (rated for something more than 8 hours) -More of a want than a need at the time but I was looking for a 2 in 1 device. This is the configuration I got: - 15.6" UltraHD 3840x2160 display, I run it at QuadHD 2560x1440 (I needed to add this as a custom resolution which was easy to do with the built-in Intel software) - i7 6560 CPU, I got this because it has the Iris 540 Graphics which is quite a bit more powerful than the standard Intel HD 520, another item on my checklist. - 16GB of RAM - 512GB SSD, performance is excellent though now they offer it with a 1TB PCIe attached SSD. I would take that instead because it's PCIe and also because it's higher capacity. I don't really need the extra performance now. This thing is fast! It's thin, light, fast, and looks great. Lots of people give me positive comments on the look I think most are surprised, probably expecting it's a Mac or something. I'm actually not a fan of metal and glass on mobile devices. Hopefully the display doesn't break. I don't like metal because it interferes with radio signals. Sure, they place the antenna's behind plastic and do things to reduce the impact but there will be impact/signal reduction. Everyone else is doing it and people think "premium devices" need to be metal and glass. Oh well. So far, I haven't noticed signal strength issues so that's good. It actually seems to be very good. Having a back-lit keyboard on a laptop is great! Oddly, I find the keyboard a little hard to read if you have the back-light on in a well lit room. This isn't a problem because you can just turn it off. Just make sure you do that before you think it's too hard to read the keyboard. I also like the feel of the keyboard and the layout of the keys, inverted-T, insert, delete, etc. I wouldn't change the keyboard. The speakers on this thing are amazing! I'm not crazy about audio or anything but my wife and I both notice that the sound is very clear and rich. In fact I hear details in music that I didn't know were there. The volume is good too. I don't know how it compares to other laptops other than the fact that it's louder than any other laptop I've had. The display is great! It's crisp and the colors are rich and accurate as far as I can tell. It works great at 2560x1440 and having that on a laptop is a huge help for me at work! I have two other external displays which I use in addition but when I'm not at my desk I'm not so restricted by my display and even at my desk I can get more on the laptop display since my monitors are only 1080p. I have the desktop scaling set to 100% (no scaling) in Windows. I love having a 2 in 1 touch screen laptop! As a laptop, I rarely use the touch screen. But for flipping through photos or playing some games I will often use my laptop with the keyboard down and display up or as a tablet. I also use the it at my desk, at work, with the keyboard down on my desk and the display up. This puts the display closer to my face to make small text easier to read. This is far more useful and helpful than I thought. It's especially great to have a large touch screen for some of the board games I like to play that are in the Windows Store. Get a touch screen 2 in 1! You'll be glad you did! Also, Windows Ink Workspace in the Windows 10 Anniversary update is great! Make sure you turn that on by right-clicking on the Start bar and choosing "Show Windows Ink Workspace button". This laptop doesn't have a built in RJ-45 network jack. I need that so I got a USB-C attached Gb NIC with three USB 3.0 ports on it. I use that kind of like a docking station. I plug my monitors in directly to the laptop but I plug in one USB-C cable and it gives me my mouse and keyboard (connected by USB) and my physical network connection. It also came in very nice, "premium", for lack of a better word, packaging, and with a very small and travel friendly power adapter, not the normal brick between two cords adapter. Things to be aware of with this laptop: - USB 3.0, not USB 3.1. That means it will max out at 5Gbps, not 10Gbps. - No PCIe attached storage unless you get the 1TB drive - No physical RJ-45 NIC - No Numeric keypad as some 15.6" laptops have None of those are problems for me. I'm very happy with this laptop! Great job HP! August 26, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Wen1019 Only buy HP when u really think u r a lucky one I have to admit it's really a pretty laptop. Even it's pricey, I still bought it... BUT... Only after 4 months, the cursor starts to malfunction. It jumps up and down in the middle of the screen and I can't get control of it. I tried disable the touchpad, disconnect the mouse, use the touchscreen but none of these worked. Called the tech support and the issue is still unsolved. I am soooooo disappointed since I spent so much money on this laptop and I deserve a better and stable performance. I would recommend everyone not to buy it unless you think you are a lucky person.

The Spectre x360 15T was the first laptop I could find that met my requirements. I ordered and got it right around the time it was released. I've had it for six months now and am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely buy it again. It was hard to find what I was looking for. I wanted the following features: - 15.6" display ~200 pixels per inch or less but higher resolution than 1080p. I work with remote consoles that do not scale and wanted to be able to see two at a time (they're often 1024x768) without scrolling and still have the text be readable. So my idea display would be 2560x1440 on a 15.6" display. That gives me a 188ppi which is usable without scaling for me. - At least an i5 CPU -16GB of RAM for running Virtual Machines - More power than the standard integrated graphics, not for gaming but just so it wouldn't get bogged down with the extra pixels at QuadHD resolution or higher. -Great battery life (rated for something more than 8 hours) -More of a want than a need at the time but I was looking for a 2 in 1 device. This is the configuration I got: - 15.6" UltraHD 3840x2160 display, I run it at QuadHD 2560x1440 (I needed to add this as a custom resolution which was easy to do with the built-in Intel software) - i7 6560 CPU, I got this because it has the Iris 540 Graphics which is quite a bit more powerful than the standard Intel HD 520, another item on my checklist. - 16GB of RAM - 512GB SSD, performance is excellent though now they offer it with a 1TB PCIe attached SSD. I would take that instead because it's PCIe and also because it's higher capacity. I don't really need the extra performance now. This thing is fast! It's thin, light, fast, and looks great. Lots of people give me positive comments on the look I think most are surprised, probably expecting it's a Mac or something. I'm actually not a fan of metal and glass on mobile devices. Hopefully the display doesn't break. I don't like metal because it interferes with radio signals. Sure, they place the antenna's behind plastic and do things to reduce the impact but there will be impact/signal reduction. Everyone else is doing it and people think "premium devices" need to be metal and glass. Oh well. So far, I haven't noticed signal strength issues so that's good. It actually seems to be very good. Having a back-lit keyboard on a laptop is great! Oddly, I find the keyboard a little hard to read if you have the back-light on in a well lit room. This isn't a problem because you can just turn it off. Just make sure you do that before you think it's too hard to read the keyboard. I also like the feel of the keyboard and the layout of the keys, inverted-T, insert, delete, etc. I wouldn't change the keyboard. The speakers on this thing are amazing! I'm not crazy about audio or anything but my wife and I both notice that the sound is very clear and rich. In fact I hear details in music that I didn't know were there. The volume is good too. I don't know how it compares to other laptops other than the fact that it's louder than any other laptop I've had. The display is great! It's crisp and the colors are rich and accurate as far as I can tell. It works great at 2560x1440 and having that on a laptop is a huge help for me at work! I have two other external displays which I use in addition but when I'm not at my desk I'm not so restricted by my display and even at my desk I can get more on the laptop display since my monitors are only 1080p. I have the desktop scaling set to 100% (no scaling) in Windows. I love having a 2 in 1 touch screen laptop! As a laptop, I rarely use the touch screen. But for flipping through photos or playing some games I will often use my laptop with the keyboard down and display up or as a tablet. I also use the it at my desk, at work, with the keyboard down on my desk and the display up. This puts the display closer to my face to make small text easier to read. This is far more useful and helpful than I thought. It's especially great to have a large touch screen for some of the board games I like to play that are in the Windows Store. Get a touch screen 2 in 1! You'll be glad you did! Also, Windows Ink Workspace in the Windows 10 Anniversary update is great! Make sure you turn that on by right-clicking on the Start bar and choosing "Show Windows Ink Workspace button". This laptop doesn't have a built in RJ-45 network jack. I need that so I got a USB-C attached Gb NIC with three USB 3.0 ports on it. I use that kind of like a docking station. I plug my monitors in directly to the laptop but I plug in one USB-C cable and it gives me my mouse and keyboard (connected by USB) and my physical network connection. It also came in very nice, "premium", for lack of a better word, packaging, and with a very small and travel friendly power adapter, not the normal brick between two cords adapter. Things to be aware of with this laptop: - USB 3.0, not USB 3.1. That means it will max out at 5Gbps, not 10Gbps. - No PCIe attached storage unless you get the 1TB drive - No physical RJ-45 NIC - No Numeric keypad as some 15.6" laptops have None of those are problems for me.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Tio12 Good, but not all I'd hoped. Screen resolution is fantastic and the touch screen works well on some programs, but not so well on others. An issue for me is the location of the touch pad, which is conveniently large, but as I type, I sometimes touch it with the heel of my hand, sending the cursor to who knows where in the document. It might be my typing techniques, but I do tend to rest the heel of my hands on the computer as I type. Perhaps a smaller touch pad would help. Finally, while the computer is elegantly slim, it is heavier than I anticipated. I purchased it because I was tired of the limitations of my iPad, and it certainly has the features that I missed on the iPad, but it lacks that elegance in design and function that the iPad has.

Rated 1 out of 5 by Wen1019 Only buy HP when u really think u r a lucky one I have to admit it's really a pretty laptop. Even it's pricey, I still bought it... BUT... Only after 4 months, the cursor starts to malfunction. It jumps up and down in the middle of the screen and I can't get control of it. I tried disable the touchpad, disconnect the mouse, use the touchscreen but none of these worked. Called the tech support and the issue is still unsolved.
