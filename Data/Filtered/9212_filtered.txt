The GPU selected is a little late to the party, so-to-speak. Lenovo should have had the GTX 980m as an option a year ago. With the NVidia 10-series in competing laptops for the same or lower prices in both 15" and 17" laptops, the Y900 has that drawback... However, the GTX 980m is still a potent GPU and will do perfectly well in this laptop and especially at 1080p which is perfectly fine for a laptop of ANY size. Lenovo laptops have EXCELLENT screens on their laptops and EXCELLENT sound quality; I am an owner of a Y50 and can verify. These two items/properties that Lenovo laptops possess are probably the best in the industry, outside of boutique/customized builds, which will cost you well over the price of this Y900. Overall, this would stand as a good to excellent gaming laptop overall.

The GPU selected is a little late to the party, so-to-speak. Lenovo should have had the GTX 980m as an option a year ago. With the NVidia 10-series in competing laptops for the same or lower prices in both 15" and 17" laptops, the Y900 has that drawback... However, the GTX 980m is still a potent GPU and will do perfectly well in this laptop and especially at 1080p which is perfectly fine for a laptop of ANY size. Lenovo laptops have EXCELLENT screens on their laptops and EXCELLENT sound quality; I am an owner of a Y50 and can verify. These two items/properties that Lenovo laptops possess are probably the best in the industry, outside of boutique/customized builds, which will cost you well over the price of this Y900. Overall, this would stand as a good to excellent gaming laptop overall.

Powered by an Intel® 6th Gen Core™ i7 6820HK overclockable processor, you can get the extra performance you need in the heat of the battle. Need a quick boost?

The subwoofer is located at the bottom of the chassis to amplify bass tones. Optimized Thermal Cooling No matter how intense the action is on the screen, the Ideapad Y900 stays remarkably cool.

Features Ideapad Y900Features Dominate the Battlefield The Ideapad Y900 is a serious gaming machine and here’s the proof: The 8GB of NVIDIA® GTX 980M discrete graphics and NVIDIA® G-Sync technology makes every scene sharper and smoother, giving you the optimal gaming experience. Powered by an Intel® 6th Gen Core™ i7 6820HK overclockable processor, you can get the extra performance you need in the heat of the battle. Need a quick boost? A single button gives you the extra performance you need on the fly to overclock your CPU and GPU. Samsung SM 951 PCIE SSDs  are among the fastest solid-state drives on the market.

Game-Changing Keyboard We don’t mess around with the keyboard, either. The Ideapad Y900 sports a mechanical backlit keyboard, allowing you to game with greater accuracy - even in the dark. Programmable macro keys, customizable settings for changing the backlighting color for different zones, and other effects via the Lenovo Nerve Center make your keyboard easier and more intuitive to use. This gamer-focused keyboard also has a secret weapon: One Key Turbo that overclocks the processor and graphics card to instantly boost performance so you can stay ahead of the competition. Customizable backlit mechanical keyboard Stunning Display & Sound The Ideapad Y900 brings all your games, movies, and images to life. The 17.3" Full HD 1920x1080 display with NVIDIA® G-SYNC technology synchronizes the graphics card to the screen’s refresh rate for the smoothest and fastest game experience.

The built-in JBL® stereo speakers and subwoofer with Dolby® Home Theater® enhanced surround sound deliver  crisp, clear audio for your games, music, and videos. The subwoofer is located at the bottom of the chassis to amplify bass tones. Optimized Thermal Cooling No matter how intense the action is on the screen, the Ideapad Y900 stays remarkably cool. By regulating its fan speed, it maintains an optimized temperature, giving you better processing and more comfortable gaming. Intake ports on the bottom and exhaust via the rear of the chassis maximize air exchange. 17.3" Full HD anti-glare display with G-SYNC Gaming Optimized Connectivity Enjoy online games on your Ideapad Y900 without the lag. High-performance Killer™ WLAN and LAN prioritizes gaming network packets over background traffic, switching bandwidth to where it’s needed most.

Rated 4 out of 5 by VA Wahoo from Nice Laptop with One Drawback... The GPU selected is a little late to the party, so-to-speak. Lenovo should have had the GTX 980m as an option a year ago. With the NVidia 10-series in competing laptops for the same or lower prices in both 15" and 17" laptops, the Y900 has that drawback... However, the GTX 980m is still a potent GPU and will do perfectly well in this laptop and especially at 1080p which is perfectly fine for a laptop of ANY size. Lenovo laptops have EXCELLENT screens on their laptops and EXCELLENT sound quality; I am an owner of a Y50 and can verify. These two items/properties that Lenovo laptops possess are probably the best in the industry, outside of boutique/customized builds, which will cost you well over the price of this Y900. Overall, this would stand as a good to excellent gaming laptop overall.
