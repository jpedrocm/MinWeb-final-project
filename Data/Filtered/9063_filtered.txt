As an example, Gmail overwhelms the system memory, and the system grinds to a glacial pace (mouse movement refresh rate drops to less than one per second). I wasn't expecting a super powered box that could run modern programs, but I did expect to be able to run the Gmail email application. Buyer beware: you can't use this system for anything other than watching low-res cat videos. And they will be choppy at that. Date published: 2016-08-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mstaton from Absolutely amazing I have had this laptop for just a little over a month now and I absolutely love it. Before this, I had a dell and it sucked. It always lagged out and was slow. This is the complete opposite, it's fast and it loads extremely fast. I like the set up of the start menu and how I can choose which apps can be pinned to my start menu. I like how big the icons are for the apps. The display is amazing, I have no problems seeing anything. I've noticed a lot of people don't like the set up of the speakers, but I do. I absolutely love this laptop and will definitely keep my Lenovo for as long as possible. I also love how light and easy to carry it is. Date published: 2016-09-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by AK Transplant from Serious upgrade over last ThinkPad Purchased my new ThinkPad 280X and love it. I got the upgraded battery, which is awesome! I watched 3 movies and used it for work... and still had 6 hours worth of battery left! The 256 gig SSD makes a huge improvement on speed and battery life. I'm loving the performance, the much improved sound over my old T400. Also, the display quality seems to be quite adequate. I typically use it in the docking station I purchased, allowing me to have the portability of a laptop, but convenience of a desktop monitor & full sized keyboard. The only thing I would have liked more would be the lighted keypad; but price became the decider.

As an example, Gmail overwhelms the system memory, and the system grinds to a glacial pace (mouse movement refresh rate drops to less than one per second). I wasn't expecting a super powered box that could run modern programs, but I did expect to be able to run the Gmail email application. Buyer beware: you can't use this system for anything other than watching low-res cat videos. And they will be choppy at that. Date published: 2016-08-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mstaton from Absolutely amazing I have had this laptop for just a little over a month now and I absolutely love it. Before this, I had a dell and it sucked. It always lagged out and was slow. This is the complete opposite, it's fast and it loads extremely fast. I like the set up of the start menu and how I can choose which apps can be pinned to my start menu. I like how big the icons are for the apps. The display is amazing, I have no problems seeing anything. I've noticed a lot of people don't like the set up of the speakers, but I do. I absolutely love this laptop and will definitely keep my Lenovo for as long as possible. I also love how light and easy to carry it is. Date published: 2016-09-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by AK Transplant from Serious upgrade over last ThinkPad Purchased my new ThinkPad 280X and love it. I got the upgraded battery, which is awesome! I watched 3 movies and used it for work... and still had 6 hours worth of battery left! The 256 gig SSD makes a huge improvement on speed and battery life. I'm loving the performance, the much improved sound over my old T400. Also, the display quality seems to be quite adequate. I typically use it in the docking station I purchased, allowing me to have the portability of a laptop, but convenience of a desktop monitor & full sized keyboard. The only thing I would have liked more would be the lighted keypad; but price became the decider.

Rated 1 out of 5 by Skeorjdn3i from Dont buy, not enough memory This might have worked as an entry level computer for light applications four or five years ago, but it just doesn't cut it anymore, and Lenovo should know better than to sell a laptop that will disappoint anyone who buys it. As an example, Gmail overwhelms the system memory, and the system grinds to a glacial pace (mouse movement refresh rate drops to less than one per second). I wasn't expecting a super powered box that could run modern programs, but I did expect to be able to run the Gmail email application. Buyer beware: you can't use this system for anything other than watching low-res cat videos. And they will be choppy at that. Date published: 2016-08-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mstaton from Absolutely amazing I have had this laptop for just a little over a month now and I absolutely love it. Before this, I had a dell and it sucked. It always lagged out and was slow. This is the complete opposite, it's fast and it loads extremely fast. I like the set up of the start menu and how I can choose which apps can be pinned to my start menu. I like how big the icons are for the apps. The display is amazing, I have no problems seeing anything. I've noticed a lot of people don't like the set up of the speakers, but I do. I absolutely love this laptop and will definitely keep my Lenovo for as long as possible. I also love how light and easy to carry it is. Date published: 2016-09-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by AK Transplant from Serious upgrade over last ThinkPad Purchased my new ThinkPad 280X and love it. I got the upgraded battery, which is awesome! I watched 3 movies and used it for work... and still had 6 hours worth of battery left! The 256 gig SSD makes a huge improvement on speed and battery life. I'm loving the performance, the much improved sound over my old T400. Also, the display quality seems to be quite adequate. I typically use it in the docking station I purchased, allowing me to have the portability of a laptop, but convenience of a desktop monitor & full sized keyboard. The only thing I would have liked more would be the lighted keypad; but price became the decider.

Rated 5 out of 5 by AK Transplant from Serious upgrade over last ThinkPad Purchased my new ThinkPad 280X and love it. I got the upgraded battery, which is awesome! I watched 3 movies and used it for work... and still had 6 hours worth of battery left! The 256 gig SSD makes a huge improvement on speed and battery life. I'm loving the performance, the much improved sound over my old T400. Also, the display quality seems to be quite adequate. I typically use it in the docking station I purchased, allowing me to have the portability of a laptop, but convenience of a desktop monitor & full sized keyboard. The only thing I would have liked more would be the lighted keypad; but price became the decider. Date published: 2016-09-08
