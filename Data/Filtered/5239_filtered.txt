Either or both displays can be rotated to landscape or portrait orientation, and the stand is depth-, height- , tilt-, and angle-adjustable so you can view both screens at eye-level as well as slightly facing each other, letting you track multiple applications and information sources at the same time. Integrated base rollers let you rotate the stand so you can more easily share your work.
