However, most console mode software still can't handle 3840x2160. After lowering resolution to HD mode (1920x1080), games work better. NVIDIA GPU - Choose default GPU using NVIDIA Control Panel "Manage 3D Setting" or with a right click. Intel GPU is fine for web browsing. Install latest Intel generic video drivers to eliminate minor video glitches. Hard disk - System has empty space for an m.2 SSD (SATA mode, not PCI-Express mode) (22mm by 80mm). Access to innards - Easy! Touchpad - Works well. To disable Touchpad if have a mouse connected, turn off "Leave touchpad on when mouse is connected" in "Mouse and Touchpad" settings in Settings / Devices. Similar option to fully disable Touchpad in Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Keyboard - Works well, though key press travel is limited by chicklet style keyboard. WASD keys play games well. H and J keys get warm when gaming. Palm rest stays cool. Control FN multi-keys and key backlighting through Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Backlighting turns off when if you stop typing for a bit and then restarts when you resume typing. CPU Fan - System fans do not turn on, except when gaming or doing something complex. System fans are noticeable, but not harsh, but will drown out normal speaker volume. An SSD will cut fan use when browsing. Memory - Ships with one 8GB memory chip (single channel DDR3L 1600MHz) with an empty slot for another 8Gb chip (system max is 16GB total). Two chips make system notably faster. Webcam - Uses Win10 "Camera" applet. Pictures are grainy. Microphones - Poor. Picks up system hiss, even with "Dell Audio" settings. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (7 of 7 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 6/1/2016   3.0 GREAT COMPUTER-BUT FAILED OUT OF THE BOX By Pumpkin33 from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: I just bought this computer 5 days ago. I was looking very forward to this computer because of the specs of the computer and the components in this model. The computer that I received was unfortunately a Lemon out of the box and after set up. The computer had mega issues with regard to freezing up on switching accounts with another user sign in as well as freezing up closing apps and could not even power down-Had to manually shut down since the computer was frozen in time and would not move. I was able to do a quick exchange for a new same model computer and brought back the Lemon to the store. Hopefully the new computer after a long set up with updating BIOS and Drivers and setting up accounts this new computer hopefully will run smooth--- Will let you know with another review- Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 5/23/2016   4.0 Good PC By harry33 from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: Finally I'm looking forward to a very long-awaited PC is now in hand .

By Alguru from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: I carefully researched this laptop. After reading the specs on several comparable laptops I decided the 7559 was the best buy for the price. It had all the features I needed. I'm a screenwriter who occasionally plays a game. My gripe was the purchasing experience. The first computer didn't work at all. The good news is the sales and tech staff switched out the machine asap with no drama. I've had the 7559 for several days and it has surpassed expectations.

However, most console mode software still can't handle 3840x2160. After lowering resolution to HD mode (1920x1080), games work better. NVIDIA GPU - Choose default GPU using NVIDIA Control Panel "Manage 3D Setting" or with a right click. Intel GPU is fine for web browsing. Install latest Intel generic video drivers to eliminate minor video glitches. Hard disk - System has empty space for an m.2 SSD (SATA mode, not PCI-Express mode) (22mm by 80mm). Access to innards - Easy! Touchpad - Works well. To disable Touchpad if have a mouse connected, turn off "Leave touchpad on when mouse is connected" in "Mouse and Touchpad" settings in Settings / Devices. Similar option to fully disable Touchpad in Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Keyboard - Works well, though key press travel is limited by chicklet style keyboard. WASD keys play games well. H and J keys get warm when gaming. Palm rest stays cool. Control FN multi-keys and key backlighting through Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Backlighting turns off when if you stop typing for a bit and then restarts when you resume typing. CPU Fan - System fans do not turn on, except when gaming or doing something complex. System fans are noticeable, but not harsh, but will drown out normal speaker volume. An SSD will cut fan use when browsing. Memory - Ships with one 8GB memory chip (single channel DDR3L 1600MHz) with an empty slot for another 8Gb chip (system max is 16GB total). Two chips make system notably faster. Webcam - Uses Win10 "Camera" applet. Pictures are grainy. Microphones - Poor. Picks up system hiss, even with "Dell Audio" settings. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (7 of 7 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 6/1/2016   3.0 GREAT COMPUTER-BUT FAILED OUT OF THE BOX By Pumpkin33 from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: I just bought this computer 5 days ago. I was looking very forward to this computer because of the specs of the computer and the components in this model. The computer that I received was unfortunately a Lemon out of the box and after set up. The computer had mega issues with regard to freezing up on switching accounts with another user sign in as well as freezing up closing apps and could not even power down-Had to manually shut down since the computer was frozen in time and would not move. I was able to do a quick exchange for a new same model computer and brought back the Lemon to the store. Hopefully the new computer after a long set up with updating BIOS and Drivers and setting up accounts this new computer hopefully will run smooth--- Will let you know with another review- Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 5/23/2016   4.0 Good PC By harry33 from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: Finally I'm looking forward to a very long-awaited PC is now in hand .

By Alguru from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: I carefully researched this laptop. After reading the specs on several comparable laptops I decided the 7559 was the best buy for the price. It had all the features I needed. I'm a screenwriter who occasionally plays a game. My gripe was the purchasing experience. The first computer didn't work at all. The good news is the sales and tech staff switched out the machine asap with no drama. I've had the 7559 for several days and it has surpassed expectations.

System fans are noticeable, but not harsh, but will drown out normal speaker volume. An SSD will cut fan use when browsing. Memory - Ships with one 8GB memory chip (single channel DDR3L 1600MHz) with an empty slot for another 8Gb chip (system max is 16GB total). Two chips make system notably faster. Webcam - Uses Win10 "Camera" applet. Pictures are grainy. Microphones - Poor. Picks up system hiss, even with "Dell Audio" settings.

I was looking very forward to this computer because of the specs of the computer and the components in this model. The computer that I received was unfortunately a Lemon out of the box and after set up. The computer had mega issues with regard to freezing up on switching accounts with another user sign in as well as freezing up closing apps and could not even power down-Had to manually shut down since the computer was frozen in time and would not move. I was able to do a quick exchange for a new same model computer and brought back the Lemon to the store.

NVIDIA GPU - Choose default GPU using NVIDIA Control Panel "Manage 3D Setting" or with a right click. Intel GPU is fine for web browsing.

To disable Touchpad if have a mouse connected, turn off "Leave touchpad on when mouse is connected" in "Mouse and Touchpad" settings in Settings / Devices. Similar option to fully disable Touchpad in Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Keyboard - Works well, though key press travel is limited by chicklet style keyboard. WASD keys play games well.

However, most console mode software still can't handle 3840x2160. After lowering resolution to HD mode (1920x1080), games work better. NVIDIA GPU - Choose default GPU using NVIDIA Control Panel "Manage 3D Setting" or with a right click. Intel GPU is fine for web browsing. Install latest Intel generic video drivers to eliminate minor video glitches. Hard disk - System has empty space for an m.2 SSD (SATA mode, not PCI-Express mode) (22mm by 80mm). Access to innards - Easy! Touchpad - Works well. To disable Touchpad if have a mouse connected, turn off "Leave touchpad on when mouse is connected" in "Mouse and Touchpad" settings in Settings / Devices. Similar option to fully disable Touchpad in Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Keyboard - Works well, though key press travel is limited by chicklet style keyboard. WASD keys play games well. H and J keys get warm when gaming. Palm rest stays cool. Control FN multi-keys and key backlighting through Control Panel / "Windows Mobility Center." Backlighting turns off when if you stop typing for a bit and then restarts when you resume typing. CPU Fan - System fans do not turn on, except when gaming or doing something complex. System fans are noticeable, but not harsh, but will drown out normal speaker volume. An SSD will cut fan use when browsing. Memory - Ships with one 8GB memory chip (single channel DDR3L 1600MHz) with an empty slot for another 8Gb chip (system max is 16GB total). Two chips make system notably faster. Webcam - Uses Win10 "Camera" applet. Pictures are grainy. Microphones - Poor. Picks up system hiss, even with "Dell Audio" settings.

6/1/2016   3.0 GREAT COMPUTER-BUT FAILED OUT OF THE BOX By Pumpkin33 from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: I just bought this computer 5 days ago. I was looking very forward to this computer because of the specs of the computer and the components in this model. The computer that I received was unfortunately a Lemon out of the box and after set up. The computer had mega issues with regard to freezing up on switching accounts with another user sign in as well as freezing up closing apps and could not even power down-Had to manually shut down since the computer was frozen in time and would not move. I was able to do a quick exchange for a new same model computer and brought back the Lemon to the store. Hopefully the new computer after a long set up with updating BIOS and Drivers and setting up accounts this new computer hopefully will run smooth--- Will let you know with another review- Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review

5/9/2016   5.0 The headache was worth it. By Alguru from Undisclosed Comments about Dell 15.6" Inspiron Intel Quad Core Laptop Computer: I carefully researched this laptop. After reading the specs on several comparable laptops I decided the 7559 was the best buy for the price. It had all the features I needed. I'm a screenwriter who occasionally plays a game. My gripe was the purchasing experience. The first computer didn't work at all. The good news is the sales and tech staff switched out the machine asap with no drama. I've had the 7559 for several days and it has surpassed expectations.
