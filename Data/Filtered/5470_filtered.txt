Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by NHawk257 Great School Computer Own a gaming laptop for most uses and needed something for school. Though I would pickup a cheap Chromebook as I use Google Drive a fair amount. After several attempts at picking up a cheap Chromebook at Best Buy and having them be always sold out, I decided on the HP. Runs very fast, boot time is amazingly quick. No connectivity issues. Battery time is outstanding. I use my Chromebook every day for school and only have to charge it once every few days. Everything I do is set to automatically sync to Drive so it never leaves school. Absolutely LOVE this chromebook September 23, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by dml1000 Unreliable Chromebook Model 14-q030-nr I bought this Chromebook at BestBuy almost 3 years ago, 2013 addition. So far the SSD card has died on me and the wifi wireless board no longer works. I was able to replace the SSD card I'm waiting for the wireless card part from HP parts department. So I think this Chromebook is unreliable. Also the screen quality is fair nothing to get excited about and the unit is very heavy and gets dirty easily. Looks like they discontinued the salmon color, I'm guessing this is a good thing. So if you buy this unit be prepared to learn how to do lots of Chromebook recoveries as well. September 7, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Grace45 Keyboard died after 18 months As another reviewer mentioned, 18 months seems to be the life span of this product. After this amount of moderate use the keyboard and track pad have stopped working. I tried opening the unit and cleaning and reseating the connectors but that only helped for about a week; of course the unit is out of warranty. HP makes a cheap product, I do not recommend their Chromebook and will not purchase an HP product again. August 5, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by thatkrcguy Worked Flawlessly for 18 Months...But... I am recommending this Chromebook based strictly on it's price-point and features/capabilities that come with the $249 price tag. However, with that being said--a word of caution regarding the consumer who plans to use this device on a daily basis. I had high hopes of using this Chromebook in my work/personal life (often travel on business), but sadly--after roughly 18 months of use--the plastic framing and hinge at the base of the display has begun to flex (no doubt due to being opened and closed hundreds of times) causing the display to fail (see photo). Again, if you plan to use this model randomly, or in a docking-mode (driving an external monitor via HDMI)...then by all means--buy one. Just keep in mind the plastic-construction will not hold up to repeated use (opening and closing of the screen). July 13, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by JoJo16 Drops network constantly This product has been nothing but trouble. I can't even go on my chromebook for half an hour without it dropping the network at least three times. Every time it drops the wifi I have to restart the chromebook, only for it to stay connected for a couple of minutes. I would accept that I have a machine that just so happens to have something wrong with it, but I am not the only one with this problem.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by NHawk257 Great School Computer Own a gaming laptop for most uses and needed something for school. Though I would pickup a cheap Chromebook as I use Google Drive a fair amount. After several attempts at picking up a cheap Chromebook at Best Buy and having them be always sold out, I decided on the HP. Runs very fast, boot time is amazingly quick. No connectivity issues. Battery time is outstanding. I use my Chromebook every day for school and only have to charge it once every few days. Everything I do is set to automatically sync to Drive so it never leaves school. Absolutely LOVE this chromebook September 23, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by dml1000 Unreliable Chromebook Model 14-q030-nr I bought this Chromebook at BestBuy almost 3 years ago, 2013 addition. So far the SSD card has died on me and the wifi wireless board no longer works. I was able to replace the SSD card I'm waiting for the wireless card part from HP parts department. So I think this Chromebook is unreliable. Also the screen quality is fair nothing to get excited about and the unit is very heavy and gets dirty easily. Looks like they discontinued the salmon color, I'm guessing this is a good thing. So if you buy this unit be prepared to learn how to do lots of Chromebook recoveries as well. September 7, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Grace45 Keyboard died after 18 months As another reviewer mentioned, 18 months seems to be the life span of this product. After this amount of moderate use the keyboard and track pad have stopped working. I tried opening the unit and cleaning and reseating the connectors but that only helped for about a week; of course the unit is out of warranty. HP makes a cheap product, I do not recommend their Chromebook and will not purchase an HP product again. August 5, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by thatkrcguy Worked Flawlessly for 18 Months...But... I am recommending this Chromebook based strictly on it's price-point and features/capabilities that come with the $249 price tag. However, with that being said--a word of caution regarding the consumer who plans to use this device on a daily basis. I had high hopes of using this Chromebook in my work/personal life (often travel on business), but sadly--after roughly 18 months of use--the plastic framing and hinge at the base of the display has begun to flex (no doubt due to being opened and closed hundreds of times) causing the display to fail (see photo). Again, if you plan to use this model randomly, or in a docking-mode (driving an external monitor via HDMI)...then by all means--buy one. Just keep in mind the plastic-construction will not hold up to repeated use (opening and closing of the screen). July 13, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by JoJo16 Drops network constantly This product has been nothing but trouble. I can't even go on my chromebook for half an hour without it dropping the network at least three times. Every time it drops the wifi I have to restart the chromebook, only for it to stay connected for a couple of minutes. I would accept that I have a machine that just so happens to have something wrong with it, but I am not the only one with this problem. July 9, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Dan37 Gets the job done Definite upgrade from the 11 inch. Fast.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by NHawk257 Great School Computer Own a gaming laptop for most uses and needed something for school. Though I would pickup a cheap Chromebook as I use Google Drive a fair amount. After several attempts at picking up a cheap Chromebook at Best Buy and having them be always sold out, I decided on the HP. Runs very fast, boot time is amazingly quick. No connectivity issues. Battery time is outstanding. I use my Chromebook every day for school and only have to charge it once every few days. Everything I do is set to automatically sync to Drive so it never leaves school. Absolutely LOVE this chromebook September 23, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by dml1000 Unreliable Chromebook Model 14-q030-nr I bought this Chromebook at BestBuy almost 3 years ago, 2013 addition. So far the SSD card has died on me and the wifi wireless board no longer works. I was able to replace the SSD card I'm waiting for the wireless card part from HP parts department. So I think this Chromebook is unreliable. Also the screen quality is fair nothing to get excited about and the unit is very heavy and gets dirty easily. Looks like they discontinued the salmon color, I'm guessing this is a good thing. So if you buy this unit be prepared to learn how to do lots of Chromebook recoveries as well. September 7, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Grace45 Keyboard died after 18 months As another reviewer mentioned, 18 months seems to be the life span of this product. After this amount of moderate use the keyboard and track pad have stopped working. I tried opening the unit and cleaning and reseating the connectors but that only helped for about a week; of course the unit is out of warranty. HP makes a cheap product, I do not recommend their Chromebook and will not purchase an HP product again. August 5, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by thatkrcguy Worked Flawlessly for 18 Months...But... I am recommending this Chromebook based strictly on it's price-point and features/capabilities that come with the $249 price tag. However, with that being said--a word of caution regarding the consumer who plans to use this device on a daily basis. I had high hopes of using this Chromebook in my work/personal life (often travel on business), but sadly--after roughly 18 months of use--the plastic framing and hinge at the base of the display has begun to flex (no doubt due to being opened and closed hundreds of times) causing the display to fail (see photo). Again, if you plan to use this model randomly, or in a docking-mode (driving an external monitor via HDMI)...then by all means--buy one. Just keep in mind the plastic-construction will not hold up to repeated use (opening and closing of the screen). July 13, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by JoJo16 Drops network constantly This product has been nothing but trouble. I can't even go on my chromebook for half an hour without it dropping the network at least three times. Every time it drops the wifi I have to restart the chromebook, only for it to stay connected for a couple of minutes. I would accept that I have a machine that just so happens to have something wrong with it, but I am not the only one with this problem.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by NHawk257 Great School Computer Own a gaming laptop for most uses and needed something for school. Though I would pickup a cheap Chromebook as I use Google Drive a fair amount. After several attempts at picking up a cheap Chromebook at Best Buy and having them be always sold out, I decided on the HP. Runs very fast, boot time is amazingly quick. No connectivity issues. Battery time is outstanding. I use my Chromebook every day for school and only have to charge it once every few days. Everything I do is set to automatically sync to Drive so it never leaves school. Absolutely LOVE this chromebook September 23, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by dml1000 Unreliable Chromebook Model 14-q030-nr I bought this Chromebook at BestBuy almost 3 years ago, 2013 addition. So far the SSD card has died on me and the wifi wireless board no longer works. I was able to replace the SSD card I'm waiting for the wireless card part from HP parts department. So I think this Chromebook is unreliable. Also the screen quality is fair nothing to get excited about and the unit is very heavy and gets dirty easily. Looks like they discontinued the salmon color, I'm guessing this is a good thing. So if you buy this unit be prepared to learn how to do lots of Chromebook recoveries as well. September 7, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Grace45 Keyboard died after 18 months As another reviewer mentioned, 18 months seems to be the life span of this product. After this amount of moderate use the keyboard and track pad have stopped working. I tried opening the unit and cleaning and reseating the connectors but that only helped for about a week; of course the unit is out of warranty. HP makes a cheap product, I do not recommend their Chromebook and will not purchase an HP product again. August 5, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by thatkrcguy Worked Flawlessly for 18 Months...But... I am recommending this Chromebook based strictly on it's price-point and features/capabilities that come with the $249 price tag. However, with that being said--a word of caution regarding the consumer who plans to use this device on a daily basis. I had high hopes of using this Chromebook in my work/personal life (often travel on business), but sadly--after roughly 18 months of use--the plastic framing and hinge at the base of the display has begun to flex (no doubt due to being opened and closed hundreds of times) causing the display to fail (see photo). Again, if you plan to use this model randomly, or in a docking-mode (driving an external monitor via HDMI)...then by all means--buy one. Just keep in mind the plastic-construction will not hold up to repeated use (opening and closing of the screen). July 13, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by JoJo16 Drops network constantly This product has been nothing but trouble. I can't even go on my chromebook for half an hour without it dropping the network at least three times. Every time it drops the wifi I have to restart the chromebook, only for it to stay connected for a couple of minutes. I would accept that I have a machine that just so happens to have something wrong with it, but I am not the only one with this problem.

However, with that being said--a word of caution regarding the consumer who plans to use this device on a daily basis. I had high hopes of using this Chromebook in my work/personal life (often travel on business), but sadly--after roughly 18 months of use--the plastic framing and hinge at the base of the display has begun to flex (no doubt due to being opened and closed hundreds of times) causing the display to fail (see photo). Again, if you plan to use this model randomly, or in a docking-mode (driving an external monitor via HDMI)...then by all means--buy one. Just keep in mind the plastic-construction will not hold up to repeated use (opening and closing of the screen). July 13, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by JoJo16 Drops network constantly This product has been nothing but trouble. I can't even go on my chromebook for half an hour without it dropping the network at least three times. Every time it drops the wifi I have to restart the chromebook, only for it to stay connected for a couple of minutes. I would accept that I have a machine that just so happens to have something wrong with it, but I am not the only one with this problem.

Rated 5 out of 5 by NHawk257 Great School Computer Own a gaming laptop for most uses and needed something for school. Though I would pickup a cheap Chromebook as I use Google Drive a fair amount. After several attempts at picking up a cheap Chromebook at Best Buy and having them be always sold out, I decided on the HP. Runs very fast, boot time is amazingly quick. No connectivity issues. Battery time is outstanding. I use my Chromebook every day for school and only have to charge it once every few days. Everything I do is set to automatically sync to Drive so it never leaves school. Absolutely LOVE this chromebook September 23, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by dml1000 Unreliable Chromebook Model 14-q030-nr I bought this Chromebook at BestBuy almost 3 years ago, 2013 addition. So far the SSD card has died on me and the wifi wireless board no longer works. I was able to replace the SSD card I'm waiting for the wireless card part from HP parts department. So I think this Chromebook is unreliable. Also the screen quality is fair nothing to get excited about and the unit is very heavy and gets dirty easily. Looks like they discontinued the salmon color, I'm guessing this is a good thing. So if you buy this unit be prepared to learn how to do lots of Chromebook recoveries as well. September 7, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Grace45 Keyboard died after 18 months As another reviewer mentioned, 18 months seems to be the life span of this product. After this amount of moderate use the keyboard and track pad have stopped working. I tried opening the unit and cleaning and reseating the connectors but that only helped for about a week; of course the unit is out of warranty.
