That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by Silic8 Speedy, well-built, responsive touchscreen. Speedy machine that acts like a tablet or a laptop. Very sleek yet sturdy. October 1, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by RobbyD Everyting I hoped for when I finally received it My old laptop was getting a little long in the tooth, although I still use it. It was an HP Pavilion 17" that was about 5 years old with Windows 7. It's biggest drawbacks were its weight and its speed even though I had replaced the HD with an SSD. But I loved the screen size, the separate numeric key pad and the fingerprint logon. The fact that it has a Blu Ray Cassette is nice but I rarely needed it. I still use the Pavilion occasionally. What I love about the Spectre 15 is its weight of about 4# compared to the over 6# weight of my old Pavilion, the incredibly clear display, much better sound, the touch screen and its speed. The overall build of the case (all metal) is another strong positive. The plastic case on my Pavilion has developed a few minor cracks over the years. Although I don't use the Spectre much in tablet mode, I still love the touch screen which I use quite a bit in laptop mode. When there are little icons to touch, I'm better off using the mouse pad though. I can live with that. For the most part, I like really like Office 2016 more than 2010. My Spectre has the Intel I7, the highest resolution display available, 16GB and a 512 GB HD. In other words, it's loaded. I think it's wiser to spend a little more money to get the very best and have it last a little longer than to scrimp and be disappointed in a few years if not right away. Even though the 3 year warranty price is a little steep, I got that too. In my opinion, laptops just are not as dependable or durable as desktops just because of their portability. Although I've never had a warranty issue with my two previous HP Laptops, I felt it was better to be safe than sorry. I usually have my Spectre plugged in but when I do use it unplugged, I've never had a problem with the battery except when I've left it unattended for a very long time but I'm guessing my actual batter live is more like 4 hrs. I have changed the power saving settings so that it does consume more power which would explain the lower than expected battery life. The switch from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro has been a little trying, but overall, I really like Windows 10, mostly because of the touch screen interface. There are/were only two negatives with the Spectre. The first negative was not having the blueray cassette built in to the Spectre. That problem was easily solved with the purchase of a very thin and light Blu-ray cassette with a USB 3.0 connection which I have used to play movies and to load software. The second negative was the delay in getting the laptop. My order was delayed about 1 month from the date I was told it would be shipped. It has something to do with the fact that it was customized. The warranty started the day I purchased it and I had to fight with HP to change the warranty start date to the date that I actually received it. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased with my Spectre. I had thought about getting the Spectre 13 which is lighter and consequently more portable. The 13 might have been okay except, being 66 yrs. old, my eye sight isn't as good as it used to be. September 18, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by MM2018 Good computer, bad material The computer itself works great. However, I have had it for only one week and there are already scratches and dents on the frame. I could understand if they appeared overtime because that's the whole point of the x360, to be able to move the laptop and tent it, etc., so maybe the frame gets banged up. However, I've only done that three times this past week, only on my coffee table, and its already scratched. What is it gonna look like in a month? A year? August 17, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Ben01 Overall a good laptop I bought this a month ago. Overall it is a good computer, it is nice, fast,light, great video quality. The only thing that I am worried about it is that the left back top side gets hot in 5 minutes if you work in different webpages or watch a video in youtube. I haven't had any problem till now but I'm worried about because I want to have this computer in good conditions for around 5 years, July 31, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Martac7 Best Lap top I have ever owned. This Lap top is all that was advertised. Outstanding features and performance too! June 27, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Ludz Excellent laptop so far. Purchased from Best Buy in Tallahassee - great customer service. Only had it a couple of days and so far it's been great. The screen is beautiful and does not seem to have any scalability issues. It is really light for a 15 " laptop. Still checking battery life, but that's not too much of a deal for me as it will be plugged in most of the time. (Appears to be around 6 hours at 50 % brightness). I am already familiar with Windows 10 so know what to expect with the OS. The keyboard is good and the backlighting is effective. The temperature of the case is low under normal use and not an issue. (I have an older MacBook Pro on which I could probably fry an egg). Overall, it is well worth the money.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by Silic8 Speedy, well-built, responsive touchscreen. Speedy machine that acts like a tablet or a laptop. Very sleek yet sturdy. October 1, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by RobbyD Everyting I hoped for when I finally received it My old laptop was getting a little long in the tooth, although I still use it. It was an HP Pavilion 17" that was about 5 years old with Windows 7. It's biggest drawbacks were its weight and its speed even though I had replaced the HD with an SSD. But I loved the screen size, the separate numeric key pad and the fingerprint logon. The fact that it has a Blu Ray Cassette is nice but I rarely needed it. I still use the Pavilion occasionally. What I love about the Spectre 15 is its weight of about 4# compared to the over 6# weight of my old Pavilion, the incredibly clear display, much better sound, the touch screen and its speed. The overall build of the case (all metal) is another strong positive. The plastic case on my Pavilion has developed a few minor cracks over the years. Although I don't use the Spectre much in tablet mode, I still love the touch screen which I use quite a bit in laptop mode. When there are little icons to touch, I'm better off using the mouse pad though. I can live with that. For the most part, I like really like Office 2016 more than 2010. My Spectre has the Intel I7, the highest resolution display available, 16GB and a 512 GB HD. In other words, it's loaded. I think it's wiser to spend a little more money to get the very best and have it last a little longer than to scrimp and be disappointed in a few years if not right away. Even though the 3 year warranty price is a little steep, I got that too. In my opinion, laptops just are not as dependable or durable as desktops just because of their portability. Although I've never had a warranty issue with my two previous HP Laptops, I felt it was better to be safe than sorry. I usually have my Spectre plugged in but when I do use it unplugged, I've never had a problem with the battery except when I've left it unattended for a very long time but I'm guessing my actual batter live is more like 4 hrs. I have changed the power saving settings so that it does consume more power which would explain the lower than expected battery life. The switch from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro has been a little trying, but overall, I really like Windows 10, mostly because of the touch screen interface. There are/were only two negatives with the Spectre. The first negative was not having the blueray cassette built in to the Spectre. That problem was easily solved with the purchase of a very thin and light Blu-ray cassette with a USB 3.0 connection which I have used to play movies and to load software. The second negative was the delay in getting the laptop. My order was delayed about 1 month from the date I was told it would be shipped. It has something to do with the fact that it was customized. The warranty started the day I purchased it and I had to fight with HP to change the warranty start date to the date that I actually received it. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased with my Spectre. I had thought about getting the Spectre 13 which is lighter and consequently more portable. The 13 might have been okay except, being 66 yrs. old, my eye sight isn't as good as it used to be. September 18, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by MM2018 Good computer, bad material The computer itself works great. However, I have had it for only one week and there are already scratches and dents on the frame. I could understand if they appeared overtime because that's the whole point of the x360, to be able to move the laptop and tent it, etc., so maybe the frame gets banged up. However, I've only done that three times this past week, only on my coffee table, and its already scratched. What is it gonna look like in a month? A year? August 17, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Ben01 Overall a good laptop I bought this a month ago. Overall it is a good computer, it is nice, fast,light, great video quality. The only thing that I am worried about it is that the left back top side gets hot in 5 minutes if you work in different webpages or watch a video in youtube. I haven't had any problem till now but I'm worried about because I want to have this computer in good conditions for around 5 years, July 31, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Martac7 Best Lap top I have ever owned. This Lap top is all that was advertised. Outstanding features and performance too! June 27, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Ludz Excellent laptop so far. Purchased from Best Buy in Tallahassee - great customer service. Only had it a couple of days and so far it's been great. The screen is beautiful and does not seem to have any scalability issues. It is really light for a 15 " laptop. Still checking battery life, but that's not too much of a deal for me as it will be plugged in most of the time. (Appears to be around 6 hours at 50 % brightness). I am already familiar with Windows 10 so know what to expect with the OS. The keyboard is good and the backlighting is effective. The temperature of the case is low under normal use and not an issue. (I have an older MacBook Pro on which I could probably fry an egg). Overall, it is well worth the money.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by Silic8 Speedy, well-built, responsive touchscreen. Speedy machine that acts like a tablet or a laptop. Very sleek yet sturdy. October 1, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by RobbyD Everyting I hoped for when I finally received it My old laptop was getting a little long in the tooth, although I still use it. It was an HP Pavilion 17" that was about 5 years old with Windows 7. It's biggest drawbacks were its weight and its speed even though I had replaced the HD with an SSD. But I loved the screen size, the separate numeric key pad and the fingerprint logon. The fact that it has a Blu Ray Cassette is nice but I rarely needed it. I still use the Pavilion occasionally. What I love about the Spectre 15 is its weight of about 4# compared to the over 6# weight of my old Pavilion, the incredibly clear display, much better sound, the touch screen and its speed. The overall build of the case (all metal) is another strong positive. The plastic case on my Pavilion has developed a few minor cracks over the years. Although I don't use the Spectre much in tablet mode, I still love the touch screen which I use quite a bit in laptop mode. When there are little icons to touch, I'm better off using the mouse pad though. I can live with that. For the most part, I like really like Office 2016 more than 2010. My Spectre has the Intel I7, the highest resolution display available, 16GB and a 512 GB HD. In other words, it's loaded. I think it's wiser to spend a little more money to get the very best and have it last a little longer than to scrimp and be disappointed in a few years if not right away. Even though the 3 year warranty price is a little steep, I got that too. In my opinion, laptops just are not as dependable or durable as desktops just because of their portability. Although I've never had a warranty issue with my two previous HP Laptops, I felt it was better to be safe than sorry. I usually have my Spectre plugged in but when I do use it unplugged, I've never had a problem with the battery except when I've left it unattended for a very long time but I'm guessing my actual batter live is more like 4 hrs. I have changed the power saving settings so that it does consume more power which would explain the lower than expected battery life. The switch from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro has been a little trying, but overall, I really like Windows 10, mostly because of the touch screen interface. There are/were only two negatives with the Spectre. The first negative was not having the blueray cassette built in to the Spectre. That problem was easily solved with the purchase of a very thin and light Blu-ray cassette with a USB 3.0 connection which I have used to play movies and to load software. The second negative was the delay in getting the laptop. My order was delayed about 1 month from the date I was told it would be shipped. It has something to do with the fact that it was customized. The warranty started the day I purchased it and I had to fight with HP to change the warranty start date to the date that I actually received it. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased with my Spectre. I had thought about getting the Spectre 13 which is lighter and consequently more portable. The 13 might have been okay except, being 66 yrs. old, my eye sight isn't as good as it used to be. September 18, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by MM2018 Good computer, bad material The computer itself works great. However, I have had it for only one week and there are already scratches and dents on the frame. I could understand if they appeared overtime because that's the whole point of the x360, to be able to move the laptop and tent it, etc., so maybe the frame gets banged up. However, I've only done that three times this past week, only on my coffee table, and its already scratched. What is it gonna look like in a month? A year? August 17, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Ben01 Overall a good laptop I bought this a month ago. Overall it is a good computer, it is nice, fast,light, great video quality. The only thing that I am worried about it is that the left back top side gets hot in 5 minutes if you work in different webpages or watch a video in youtube. I haven't had any problem till now but I'm worried about because I want to have this computer in good conditions for around 5 years, July 31, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Martac7 Best Lap top I have ever owned. This Lap top is all that was advertised. Outstanding features and performance too! June 27, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Ludz Excellent laptop so far. Purchased from Best Buy in Tallahassee - great customer service. Only had it a couple of days and so far it's been great. The screen is beautiful and does not seem to have any scalability issues. It is really light for a 15 " laptop. Still checking battery life, but that's not too much of a deal for me as it will be plugged in most of the time. (Appears to be around 6 hours at 50 % brightness). I am already familiar with Windows 10 so know what to expect with the OS. The keyboard is good and the backlighting is effective. The temperature of the case is low under normal use and not an issue. (I have an older MacBook Pro on which I could probably fry an egg). Overall, it is well worth the money.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Exceptional battery life To give you the all-day battery life1 you've been waiting for, we started by building a convertible PC with one of the highest capacity batteries in its class. Then we carefully curated our software to prevent battery-hogging apps from running in the background, and we integrated Panel Self Refreshing Technology into the Quad HD and 4K displays to reduce battery drain without dimming the screen. 1Windows 10/ MM14 battery life will vary depending on various factors including product model, configuration, loaded applications, features, use, wireless functionality, and power management settings. The maximum capacity of the battery will naturally decrease with time and usage. See www.bapco.com for additional details.

4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by Silic8 Speedy, well-built, responsive touchscreen. Speedy machine that acts like a tablet or a laptop. Very sleek yet sturdy. October 1, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by RobbyD Everyting I hoped for when I finally received it My old laptop was getting a little long in the tooth, although I still use it. It was an HP Pavilion 17" that was about 5 years old with Windows 7. It's biggest drawbacks were its weight and its speed even though I had replaced the HD with an SSD. But I loved the screen size, the separate numeric key pad and the fingerprint logon. The fact that it has a Blu Ray Cassette is nice but I rarely needed it. I still use the Pavilion occasionally. What I love about the Spectre 15 is its weight of about 4# compared to the over 6# weight of my old Pavilion, the incredibly clear display, much better sound, the touch screen and its speed. The overall build of the case (all metal) is another strong positive. The plastic case on my Pavilion has developed a few minor cracks over the years. Although I don't use the Spectre much in tablet mode, I still love the touch screen which I use quite a bit in laptop mode. When there are little icons to touch, I'm better off using the mouse pad though. I can live with that. For the most part, I like really like Office 2016 more than 2010. My Spectre has the Intel I7, the highest resolution display available, 16GB and a 512 GB HD. In other words, it's loaded. I think it's wiser to spend a little more money to get the very best and have it last a little longer than to scrimp and be disappointed in a few years if not right away. Even though the 3 year warranty price is a little steep, I got that too. In my opinion, laptops just are not as dependable or durable as desktops just because of their portability. Although I've never had a warranty issue with my two previous HP Laptops, I felt it was better to be safe than sorry. I usually have my Spectre plugged in but when I do use it unplugged, I've never had a problem with the battery except when I've left it unattended for a very long time but I'm guessing my actual batter live is more like 4 hrs. I have changed the power saving settings so that it does consume more power which would explain the lower than expected battery life. The switch from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro has been a little trying, but overall, I really like Windows 10, mostly because of the touch screen interface. There are/were only two negatives with the Spectre. The first negative was not having the blueray cassette built in to the Spectre. That problem was easily solved with the purchase of a very thin and light Blu-ray cassette with a USB 3.0 connection which I have used to play movies and to load software. The second negative was the delay in getting the laptop. My order was delayed about 1 month from the date I was told it would be shipped. It has something to do with the fact that it was customized. The warranty started the day I purchased it and I had to fight with HP to change the warranty start date to the date that I actually received it. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased with my Spectre. I had thought about getting the Spectre 13 which is lighter and consequently more portable. The 13 might have been okay except, being 66 yrs. old, my eye sight isn't as good as it used to be. September 18, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by MM2018 Good computer, bad material The computer itself works great. However, I have had it for only one week and there are already scratches and dents on the frame. I could understand if they appeared overtime because that's the whole point of the x360, to be able to move the laptop and tent it, etc., so maybe the frame gets banged up. However, I've only done that three times this past week, only on my coffee table, and its already scratched. What is it gonna look like in a month? A year? August 17, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Ben01 Overall a good laptop I bought this a month ago. Overall it is a good computer, it is nice, fast,light, great video quality. The only thing that I am worried about it is that the left back top side gets hot in 5 minutes if you work in different webpages or watch a video in youtube. I haven't had any problem till now but I'm worried about because I want to have this computer in good conditions for around 5 years, July 31, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Martac7 Best Lap top I have ever owned. This Lap top is all that was advertised. Outstanding features and performance too! June 27, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Ludz Excellent laptop so far. Purchased from Best Buy in Tallahassee - great customer service. Only had it a couple of days and so far it's been great. The screen is beautiful and does not seem to have any scalability issues. It is really light for a 15 " laptop. Still checking battery life, but that's not too much of a deal for me as it will be plugged in most of the time. (Appears to be around 6 hours at 50 % brightness). I am already familiar with Windows 10 so know what to expect with the OS. The keyboard is good and the backlighting is effective. The temperature of the case is low under normal use and not an issue. (I have an older MacBook Pro on which I could probably fry an egg). Overall, it is well worth the money.

(Appears to be around 6 hours at 50 % brightness). I am already familiar with Windows 10 so know what to expect with the OS. The keyboard is good and the backlighting is effective. The temperature of the case is low under normal use and not an issue. (I have an older MacBook Pro on which I could probably fry an egg). Overall, it is well worth the money.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Silic8 Speedy, well-built, responsive touchscreen. Speedy machine that acts like a tablet or a laptop. Very sleek yet sturdy. October 1, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by RobbyD Everyting I hoped for when I finally received it My old laptop was getting a little long in the tooth, although I still use it. It was an HP Pavilion 17" that was about 5 years old with Windows 7. It's biggest drawbacks were its weight and its speed even though I had replaced the HD with an SSD. But I loved the screen size, the separate numeric key pad and the fingerprint logon. The fact that it has a Blu Ray Cassette is nice but I rarely needed it. I still use the Pavilion occasionally. What I love about the Spectre 15 is its weight of about 4# compared to the over 6# weight of my old Pavilion, the incredibly clear display, much better sound, the touch screen and its speed. The overall build of the case (all metal) is another strong positive. The plastic case on my Pavilion has developed a few minor cracks over the years. Although I don't use the Spectre much in tablet mode, I still love the touch screen which I use quite a bit in laptop mode. When there are little icons to touch, I'm better off using the mouse pad though. I can live with that. For the most part, I like really like Office 2016 more than 2010. My Spectre has the Intel I7, the highest resolution display available, 16GB and a 512 GB HD. In other words, it's loaded. I think it's wiser to spend a little more money to get the very best and have it last a little longer than to scrimp and be disappointed in a few years if not right away. Even though the 3 year warranty price is a little steep, I got that too. In my opinion, laptops just are not as dependable or durable as desktops just because of their portability. Although I've never had a warranty issue with my two previous HP Laptops, I felt it was better to be safe than sorry. I usually have my Spectre plugged in but when I do use it unplugged, I've never had a problem with the battery except when I've left it unattended for a very long time but I'm guessing my actual batter live is more like 4 hrs. I have changed the power saving settings so that it does consume more power which would explain the lower than expected battery life. The switch from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro has been a little trying, but overall, I really like Windows 10, mostly because of the touch screen interface. There are/were only two negatives with the Spectre. The first negative was not having the blueray cassette built in to the Spectre. That problem was easily solved with the purchase of a very thin and light Blu-ray cassette with a USB 3.0 connection which I have used to play movies and to load software. The second negative was the delay in getting the laptop. My order was delayed about 1 month from the date I was told it would be shipped. It has something to do with the fact that it was customized. The warranty started the day I purchased it and I had to fight with HP to change the warranty start date to the date that I actually received it. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased with my Spectre. I had thought about getting the Spectre 13 which is lighter and consequently more portable. The 13 might have been okay except, being 66 yrs. old, my eye sight isn't as good as it used to be. September 18, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by MM2018 Good computer, bad material The computer itself works great. However, I have had it for only one week and there are already scratches and dents on the frame. I could understand if they appeared overtime because that's the whole point of the x360, to be able to move the laptop and tent it, etc., so maybe the frame gets banged up. However, I've only done that three times this past week, only on my coffee table, and its already scratched. What is it gonna look like in a month? A year?

The only thing that I am worried about it is that the left back top side gets hot in 5 minutes if you work in different webpages or watch a video in youtube. I haven't had any problem till now but I'm worried about because I want to have this computer in good conditions for around 5 years, July 31, 2016
