Firstly, the weight is 2kg!!! Secondly, the display isnt AntiGlare! This may not be of too much significance for some, but I am someone who bought this for lightweight inspite of having all these awesome features! Also, Antiglare adds an edge. Performance wise, it takes too long to startup for an i7 processor. You need to disable many lenovo startup applications(the main culprit being Lenovo Solution Centre). Once done, this is pretty fast. So I would recommend this laptop, but the specs are incorrect. So you better experience a live model once before deciding. Date published: 2016-07-18 Rated 1 out of 5 by hbrink from Regretful Purchase I purchased this laptop about a month and a half ago and I am experiencing many issues with it. First of all, I hate where the right shift key is located. Second, the screen shuts off quite often and no matter what I try it wont turn back on. I have to do a hard shut down and turn it back on. Third, the screen glitches to where touching it and using the mousepad doesn't work whatsoever. Fourth, its super slow to start up and even with some excellent wifi connections its still slower than molasses. Needless to say I'm not happy with it at all and will never purchase another Lenovo laptop. Back to big brands. Date published: 2016-08-12 Rated 4 out of 5 by lsapig from Good laptop This laptop replaced my old Sony and so far has been an excellent choice. It's light enough to carry, screen is excellent, sound is good and features such as backlit keyboard work well. I've only used the various tablet modes a handful of times, but other than being really to hefty to hold in one hand, I enjoy having the functionality. My only gripe is that the mouse buttons on the keypad are a little annoying in that I keep hitting the right click, when I think I'm hitting left click. Also, I tried to install steam, but the drivers for the Radeon site kept "updating" my video card to a lower model than the M430 installed. Overall, I'm enjoying the laptop, especially the rapid charging and the i7 processor with 16 GB of RAM makes this pretty snappy. Hope this helps!

Firstly, the weight is 2kg!!! Secondly, the display isnt AntiGlare! This may not be of too much significance for some, but I am someone who bought this for lightweight inspite of having all these awesome features! Also, Antiglare adds an edge. Performance wise, it takes too long to startup for an i7 processor. You need to disable many lenovo startup applications(the main culprit being Lenovo Solution Centre). Once done, this is pretty fast. So I would recommend this laptop, but the specs are incorrect. So you better experience a live model once before deciding. Date published: 2016-07-18 Rated 1 out of 5 by hbrink from Regretful Purchase I purchased this laptop about a month and a half ago and I am experiencing many issues with it. First of all, I hate where the right shift key is located. Second, the screen shuts off quite often and no matter what I try it wont turn back on. I have to do a hard shut down and turn it back on. Third, the screen glitches to where touching it and using the mousepad doesn't work whatsoever. Fourth, its super slow to start up and even with some excellent wifi connections its still slower than molasses. Needless to say I'm not happy with it at all and will never purchase another Lenovo laptop. Back to big brands. Date published: 2016-08-12 Rated 4 out of 5 by lsapig from Good laptop This laptop replaced my old Sony and so far has been an excellent choice. It's light enough to carry, screen is excellent, sound is good and features such as backlit keyboard work well. I've only used the various tablet modes a handful of times, but other than being really to hefty to hold in one hand, I enjoy having the functionality. My only gripe is that the mouse buttons on the keypad are a little annoying in that I keep hitting the right click, when I think I'm hitting left click. Also, I tried to install steam, but the drivers for the Radeon site kept "updating" my video card to a lower model than the M430 installed. Overall, I'm enjoying the laptop, especially the rapid charging and the i7 processor with 16 GB of RAM makes this pretty snappy. Hope this helps!

Rated 3 out of 5 by Kedhar Guhan from BEWARE : Incorrect Specs I bought this laptop for its portablility, i.e. lightweight.($849.99 one, 80SA0001US) When I chose my specific model, before ordering i could see its particular spec(see the first and last spec in the pic). Firstly, the weight is 2kg!!! Secondly, the display isnt AntiGlare! This may not be of too much significance for some, but I am someone who bought this for lightweight inspite of having all these awesome features! Also, Antiglare adds an edge. Performance wise, it takes too long to startup for an i7 processor. You need to disable many lenovo startup applications(the main culprit being Lenovo Solution Centre). Once done, this is pretty fast. So I would recommend this laptop, but the specs are incorrect. So you better experience a live model once before deciding. Date published: 2016-07-18 Rated 1 out of 5 by hbrink from Regretful Purchase I purchased this laptop about a month and a half ago and I am experiencing many issues with it. First of all, I hate where the right shift key is located. Second, the screen shuts off quite often and no matter what I try it wont turn back on. I have to do a hard shut down and turn it back on. Third, the screen glitches to where touching it and using the mousepad doesn't work whatsoever. Fourth, its super slow to start up and even with some excellent wifi connections its still slower than molasses. Needless to say I'm not happy with it at all and will never purchase another Lenovo laptop. Back to big brands. Date published: 2016-08-12 Rated 4 out of 5 by lsapig from Good laptop This laptop replaced my old Sony and so far has been an excellent choice. It's light enough to carry, screen is excellent, sound is good and features such as backlit keyboard work well. I've only used the various tablet modes a handful of times, but other than being really to hefty to hold in one hand, I enjoy having the functionality. My only gripe is that the mouse buttons on the keypad are a little annoying in that I keep hitting the right click, when I think I'm hitting left click. Also, I tried to install steam, but the drivers for the Radeon site kept "updating" my video card to a lower model than the M430 installed. Overall, I'm enjoying the laptop, especially the rapid charging and the i7 processor with 16 GB of RAM makes this pretty snappy. Hope this helps!
