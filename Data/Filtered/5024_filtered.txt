That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 3 out of 5 by DiannaLouise Constant problem with audio drivers I purchased my first Spectre in May 2016, I've had to have the audio drivers re-stalled four times and the internal fan broke. The computer was replaced on Fri., Sept 30, 2016. Windows did an update and once again, the audio drivers failed. I have to take the computer in for service AGAIN!!! I am demanding another new computer and/or completely different brand/model of computer. I am livid!! October 2, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by silverMUFFIN Fantastic for college I use this laptop for all of my college classes and it works great. September 27, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Dwindle06 Great laptop with a couple annoyances I bought this laptop for college and so far has performed quite well. Having the touchscreen is great in a pinch, as is the rotating hinge, although it is a little too heavy and cumbersome to use as a tablet. Nevertheless it is still handy to have if you need it. Additionally, the hinges are a little on the weak side; they tend to move on their own if the laptop is jostled around 150-210 degrees. I love the big trackpad, but something that is bothersome is sometimes when I physically click the trackpad it shifts the mouse onscreen so that it doesn't click what I want it to. The speakers are also pretty tinny. Other than these minor annoyances, the laptop has served me well. It is speedy, the keyboard has a good feel to it and is backlit, and the battery life is phenomenal. No laptop comes without its compromises and I feel as though this is one of the best in its price range. September 2, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by DB71 Cracked Screen Bought 2 units 13' and 15" both screens cracked in less than a month they were handled with care. Really disappointed as this is a great laptop. August 31, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by vish12 God awful design and terrible customer service Save yourself a lot of pain and just don't buy this laptop. I bought 2 versions of this laptop after looking at all the amazing reviews and was initially very satisfied. What the reviews don't tell you is that this laptop is not at all durable. 1. First problem I experienced was a cracked screen from just holding it one day. Just carrying closed in my hands like you would a notebook....the way you're supposed to carry a laptop. It's not really feasible to replace the screen yourself(they taped it on so you would have to break the glass to remove it). So that cost me $350 to get it replaced and, after a week and a half of waiting for the box to send it back, its still not here. 2. Second problem on second laptop is with the charging port. My laptop no longer charges...after a year of use I no longer have a warranty on it so they want me to pay another $300 to replace the entire motherboard. This is ENTIRELY their fault because when you open the laptop you see that the power connector is held there by a single screw. That means that everytime you plug in the charger it will move around and in doing so it will eventually break one of the connecting wires. Normally I don't buy laptops that are this expensive but I thought this would be a good deal. Its not worth the numerous design flaws and god awful customer service that HP has (hung up on me while I was trying to explain the problem...). I didn't hate HP before, I actually thought they were a decent company, but man I will never buy a product from them again. August 21, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Sailorzx7 Very good laptop! I have had mine for over one year. The only problem is that now my screen in Crome in starting to lock up and flash frequently. I have to close the browser and then restart. Not sure if Windows 10 would run better, I have Windows 8.1.

The following applies to HP systems with Intel Skylake or next-generation silicon chip-based system shipping with Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 Pro systems downgraded to Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 8.1: This version of Windows running with the processor or chipsets used in this system has limited support from Microsoft. For more information about Microsoft's support, please see Microsoft's Support Lifecycle FAQ at https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle 4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 3 out of 5 by DiannaLouise Constant problem with audio drivers I purchased my first Spectre in May 2016, I've had to have the audio drivers re-stalled four times and the internal fan broke. The computer was replaced on Fri., Sept 30, 2016. Windows did an update and once again, the audio drivers failed. I have to take the computer in for service AGAIN!!! I am demanding another new computer and/or completely different brand/model of computer. I am livid!! October 2, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by silverMUFFIN Fantastic for college I use this laptop for all of my college classes and it works great. September 27, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Dwindle06 Great laptop with a couple annoyances I bought this laptop for college and so far has performed quite well. Having the touchscreen is great in a pinch, as is the rotating hinge, although it is a little too heavy and cumbersome to use as a tablet. Nevertheless it is still handy to have if you need it. Additionally, the hinges are a little on the weak side; they tend to move on their own if the laptop is jostled around 150-210 degrees. I love the big trackpad, but something that is bothersome is sometimes when I physically click the trackpad it shifts the mouse onscreen so that it doesn't click what I want it to. The speakers are also pretty tinny. Other than these minor annoyances, the laptop has served me well. It is speedy, the keyboard has a good feel to it and is backlit, and the battery life is phenomenal. No laptop comes without its compromises and I feel as though this is one of the best in its price range. September 2, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by DB71 Cracked Screen Bought 2 units 13' and 15" both screens cracked in less than a month they were handled with care. Really disappointed as this is a great laptop. August 31, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by vish12 God awful design and terrible customer service Save yourself a lot of pain and just don't buy this laptop. I bought 2 versions of this laptop after looking at all the amazing reviews and was initially very satisfied. What the reviews don't tell you is that this laptop is not at all durable. 1. First problem I experienced was a cracked screen from just holding it one day. Just carrying closed in my hands like you would a notebook....the way you're supposed to carry a laptop. It's not really feasible to replace the screen yourself(they taped it on so you would have to break the glass to remove it). So that cost me $350 to get it replaced and, after a week and a half of waiting for the box to send it back, its still not here. 2. Second problem on second laptop is with the charging port. My laptop no longer charges...after a year of use I no longer have a warranty on it so they want me to pay another $300 to replace the entire motherboard. This is ENTIRELY their fault because when you open the laptop you see that the power connector is held there by a single screw. That means that everytime you plug in the charger it will move around and in doing so it will eventually break one of the connecting wires. Normally I don't buy laptops that are this expensive but I thought this would be a good deal. Its not worth the numerous design flaws and god awful customer service that HP has (hung up on me while I was trying to explain the problem...). I didn't hate HP before, I actually thought they were a decent company, but man I will never buy a product from them again. August 21, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Sailorzx7 Very good laptop! I have had mine for over one year. The only problem is that now my screen in Crome in starting to lock up and flash frequently. I have to close the browser and then restart. Not sure if Windows 10 would run better, I have Windows 8.1.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 3 out of 5 by DiannaLouise Constant problem with audio drivers I purchased my first Spectre in May 2016, I've had to have the audio drivers re-stalled four times and the internal fan broke. The computer was replaced on Fri., Sept 30, 2016. Windows did an update and once again, the audio drivers failed. I have to take the computer in for service AGAIN!!! I am demanding another new computer and/or completely different brand/model of computer. I am livid!! October 2, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by silverMUFFIN Fantastic for college I use this laptop for all of my college classes and it works great. September 27, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Dwindle06 Great laptop with a couple annoyances I bought this laptop for college and so far has performed quite well. Having the touchscreen is great in a pinch, as is the rotating hinge, although it is a little too heavy and cumbersome to use as a tablet. Nevertheless it is still handy to have if you need it. Additionally, the hinges are a little on the weak side; they tend to move on their own if the laptop is jostled around 150-210 degrees. I love the big trackpad, but something that is bothersome is sometimes when I physically click the trackpad it shifts the mouse onscreen so that it doesn't click what I want it to. The speakers are also pretty tinny. Other than these minor annoyances, the laptop has served me well. It is speedy, the keyboard has a good feel to it and is backlit, and the battery life is phenomenal. No laptop comes without its compromises and I feel as though this is one of the best in its price range. September 2, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by DB71 Cracked Screen Bought 2 units 13' and 15" both screens cracked in less than a month they were handled with care. Really disappointed as this is a great laptop. August 31, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by vish12 God awful design and terrible customer service Save yourself a lot of pain and just don't buy this laptop. I bought 2 versions of this laptop after looking at all the amazing reviews and was initially very satisfied. What the reviews don't tell you is that this laptop is not at all durable. 1. First problem I experienced was a cracked screen from just holding it one day. Just carrying closed in my hands like you would a notebook....the way you're supposed to carry a laptop. It's not really feasible to replace the screen yourself(they taped it on so you would have to break the glass to remove it). So that cost me $350 to get it replaced and, after a week and a half of waiting for the box to send it back, its still not here. 2. Second problem on second laptop is with the charging port. My laptop no longer charges...after a year of use I no longer have a warranty on it so they want me to pay another $300 to replace the entire motherboard. This is ENTIRELY their fault because when you open the laptop you see that the power connector is held there by a single screw. That means that everytime you plug in the charger it will move around and in doing so it will eventually break one of the connecting wires. Normally I don't buy laptops that are this expensive but I thought this would be a good deal. Its not worth the numerous design flaws and god awful customer service that HP has (hung up on me while I was trying to explain the problem...). I didn't hate HP before, I actually thought they were a decent company, but man I will never buy a product from them again. August 21, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Sailorzx7 Very good laptop! I have had mine for over one year. The only problem is that now my screen in Crome in starting to lock up and flash frequently. I have to close the browser and then restart. Not sure if Windows 10 would run better, I have Windows 8.1.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture – not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 3 out of 5 by DiannaLouise Constant problem with audio drivers I purchased my first Spectre in May 2016, I've had to have the audio drivers re-stalled four times and the internal fan broke. The computer was replaced on Fri., Sept 30, 2016. Windows did an update and once again, the audio drivers failed. I have to take the computer in for service AGAIN!!! I am demanding another new computer and/or completely different brand/model of computer. I am livid!! October 2, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by silverMUFFIN Fantastic for college I use this laptop for all of my college classes and it works great. September 27, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Dwindle06 Great laptop with a couple annoyances I bought this laptop for college and so far has performed quite well. Having the touchscreen is great in a pinch, as is the rotating hinge, although it is a little too heavy and cumbersome to use as a tablet. Nevertheless it is still handy to have if you need it. Additionally, the hinges are a little on the weak side; they tend to move on their own if the laptop is jostled around 150-210 degrees. I love the big trackpad, but something that is bothersome is sometimes when I physically click the trackpad it shifts the mouse onscreen so that it doesn't click what I want it to. The speakers are also pretty tinny. Other than these minor annoyances, the laptop has served me well. It is speedy, the keyboard has a good feel to it and is backlit, and the battery life is phenomenal. No laptop comes without its compromises and I feel as though this is one of the best in its price range. September 2, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by DB71 Cracked Screen Bought 2 units 13' and 15" both screens cracked in less than a month they were handled with care. Really disappointed as this is a great laptop. August 31, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by vish12 God awful design and terrible customer service Save yourself a lot of pain and just don't buy this laptop. I bought 2 versions of this laptop after looking at all the amazing reviews and was initially very satisfied. What the reviews don't tell you is that this laptop is not at all durable. 1. First problem I experienced was a cracked screen from just holding it one day. Just carrying closed in my hands like you would a notebook....the way you're supposed to carry a laptop. It's not really feasible to replace the screen yourself(they taped it on so you would have to break the glass to remove it). So that cost me $350 to get it replaced and, after a week and a half of waiting for the box to send it back, its still not here. 2. Second problem on second laptop is with the charging port. My laptop no longer charges...after a year of use I no longer have a warranty on it so they want me to pay another $300 to replace the entire motherboard. This is ENTIRELY their fault because when you open the laptop you see that the power connector is held there by a single screw. That means that everytime you plug in the charger it will move around and in doing so it will eventually break one of the connecting wires. Normally I don't buy laptops that are this expensive but I thought this would be a good deal. Its not worth the numerous design flaws and god awful customer service that HP has (hung up on me while I was trying to explain the problem...). I didn't hate HP before, I actually thought they were a decent company, but man I will never buy a product from them again. August 21, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Sailorzx7 Very good laptop! I have had mine for over one year. The only problem is that now my screen in Crome in starting to lock up and flash frequently. I have to close the browser and then restart. Not sure if Windows 10 would run better, I have Windows 8.1.
