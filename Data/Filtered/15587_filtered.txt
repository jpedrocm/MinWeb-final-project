Unlike most gaming laptops, the Phantom is truly portable. The 14” Full HD screen is the ideal size for gaming on the commute, at a friend's house, or on the sofa, as it's large enough for immersive gameplay without being difficult to carry. Plus, there are HDMI and Mini-DisplayPorts which support up to three external monitors if you want to game on a bigger screen.  Powered by Intel® There's no worry about whether the Phantom will run your games or demanding software properly as it's powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor. Besides not holding the graphics card back, the i7 processor is more than capable of running industry standard design, media editing, and music production software - perfect for working and creating when you're not gaming. Dual storage You can benefit from both high capacity and high-performance storage as the Phantom features both a conventional hard drive and a super-fast solid-state drive (SSD). The 1 TB hard drive has plenty of room for music, films, and more, while you can install your most played games to the SSD to benefit from reduced load times and less texture pop-in on visually demanding games. Built for gamers Exclusive to MSI are built-in SteelSeries gaming keyboards. With the same feedback and response as a stand-alone keyboard, you can game at your best. It's backlit too, which looks great and allows you to consistently hit the right keys even in the lowest light. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.   Specification Technical specifications for MSI Phantom GS40 6QE 14" Gaming Laptop - Black OVERVIEW Type Gaming laptop Operating system Windows 10 (64-bit) SPECIFICATION Processor - Intel® Core™ i7-6700HQ Processor - Quad-core - 2.6 GHz / 3.5 GHz with Turbo Boost - 6 MB cache Memory (RAM) 16 GB DDR4 (64 GB maximum installable RAM) Graphics card NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M (3 GB GDDR5) Storage - 1 TB HDD, 7200 rpm - 128 GB SSD SCREEN Touchscreen No Screen size 14" Screen type LED Resolution 1920 x 1080 Screen features LED backlighting CONNECTIVITY Wireless Killer 802.11 ac Ethernet Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000) Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.0 USB USB 3.0 x 2 Video interface - HDMI x 1 - Mini-DisplayPort x 1 Audio interface 3.5 mm jack MEDIA Optical disc drive No Memory card reader SD card reader SOUND Sound - ESS Technology SABRE HiFi - Nahimic Sound Enhancer Speakers Integrated Dynaaudio speakers FEATURES Camera Integrated HD webcam Microphone Yes Mouse / trackpad Multitouch trackpad Keyboard Full-size backlit keyboard with numeric keypad Security features Kensington lock slot POWER Battery type 4-cell Battery life Up to 4 hours GENERAL Colour Black Box contents - MSI Phantom GS40 6QE 14" Gaming Laptop - AC power adapter - Driver CD Dimensions 22 x 345 x 245 mm (H x W x D) Weight 1.6 kg Manufacturer’s guarantee 1 year Customer reviews Customer reviews Ask an owner Reviews of PC World Phantom GS40 6QE 14" Gaming Laptop - Black reviews verified by reevoo 4 reviews Reviews from: All purchasersMusic, gaming or video fanOther Sort by: Most recentMost helpfulLowest scoreHighest score (8.3 out of 10) Battery life 7.3 Design 7.8 Size and weight 9.0 Performance 8.0 Value for money 8.0 Overall rating 8.3 Scores 8.3 out of 10 based on 4 reviews Show more score details (10 out of 10) Ben Hassocks Music, gaming or video fan Good Points+ Very Slick, Visually crisp and performs flawlessly.

Keyboard is lovely, some reviews claim it bends when typing, maybe if you use hammers to type, or are of the special variety.

Dual storage You can benefit from both high capacity and high-performance storage as the Phantom features both a conventional hard drive and a super-fast solid-state drive (SSD).

Product information Highlights - Compact dimensions and NVIDIA graphics deliver desktop-quality gaming wherever you are - Quad-core Intel® processing runs your games and demanding software flawlessly - Hard drive and SSD storage combines capacity and storage for responsive computing - Backlit Steel Series keyboard gives you the control you need to game at your best Built for portable gaming From the biggest triple-A titles like the Witcher 3 to the most popular online games like League of Legends, you can experience all your favourites with impressive detail and high FPS. Unlike most gaming laptops, the Phantom is truly portable. The 14” Full HD screen is the ideal size for gaming on the commute, at a friend's house, or on the sofa, as it's large enough for immersive gameplay without being difficult to carry. Plus, there are HDMI and Mini-DisplayPorts which support up to three external monitors if you want to game on a bigger screen.  Powered by Intel® There's no worry about whether the Phantom will run your games or demanding software properly as it's powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor. Besides not holding the graphics card back, the i7 processor is more than capable of running industry standard design, media editing, and music production software - perfect for working and creating when you're not gaming. Dual storage You can benefit from both high capacity and high-performance storage as the Phantom features both a conventional hard drive and a super-fast solid-state drive (SSD). The 1 TB hard drive has plenty of room for music, films, and more, while you can install your most played games to the SSD to benefit from reduced load times and less texture pop-in on visually demanding games. Built for gamers Exclusive to MSI are built-in SteelSeries gaming keyboards. With the same feedback and response as a stand-alone keyboard, you can game at your best. It's backlit too, which looks great and allows you to consistently hit the right keys even in the lowest light. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.   Specification Technical specifications for MSI Phantom GS40 6QE 14" Gaming Laptop - Black OVERVIEW Type Gaming laptop Operating system Windows 10 (64-bit) SPECIFICATION Processor - Intel® Core™ i7-6700HQ Processor - Quad-core - 2.6 GHz / 3.5 GHz with Turbo Boost - 6 MB cache Memory (RAM) 16 GB DDR4 (64 GB maximum installable RAM) Graphics card NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M (3 GB GDDR5) Storage - 1 TB HDD, 7200 rpm - 128 GB SSD SCREEN Touchscreen No Screen size 14" Screen type LED Resolution 1920 x 1080 Screen features LED backlighting CONNECTIVITY Wireless Killer 802.11 ac Ethernet Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000) Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.0 USB USB 3.0 x 2 Video interface - HDMI x 1 - Mini-DisplayPort x 1 Audio interface 3.5 mm jack MEDIA Optical disc drive No Memory card reader SD card reader SOUND Sound - ESS Technology SABRE HiFi - Nahimic Sound Enhancer Speakers Integrated Dynaaudio speakers FEATURES Camera Integrated HD webcam Microphone Yes Mouse / trackpad Multitouch trackpad Keyboard Full-size backlit keyboard with numeric keypad Security features Kensington lock slot POWER Battery type 4-cell Battery life Up to 4 hours GENERAL Colour Black Box contents - MSI Phantom GS40 6QE 14" Gaming Laptop - AC power adapter - Driver CD Dimensions 22 x 345 x 245 mm (H x W x D) Weight 1.6 kg Manufacturer’s guarantee 1 year Customer reviews Customer reviews Ask an owner Reviews of PC World Phantom GS40 6QE 14" Gaming Laptop - Black reviews verified by reevoo 4 reviews Reviews from: All purchasersMusic, gaming or video fanOther Sort by: Most recentMost helpfulLowest scoreHighest score (8.3 out of 10) Battery life 7.3 Design 7.8 Size and weight 9.0 Performance 8.0 Value for money 8.0 Overall rating 8.3 Scores 8.3 out of 10 based on 4 reviews Show more score details (10 out of 10) Ben Hassocks Music, gaming or video fan Good Points+ Very Slick, Visually crisp and performs flawlessly.

This is very much a Man design, like a stealth jet or an Armalite, no half eaten fruit here.. the emblem is a frikin dragon, enough said. Bad Points? Quite noisy fans, however, they do the job amazingly, the laptop stays cool and roasts everything around it... may try making popcorn while I game.. No complimentary orange sherbet, what's a man to do? All scores from this user: Was this review helpful?
