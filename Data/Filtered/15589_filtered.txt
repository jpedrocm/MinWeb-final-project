Using the 360 degree dual-torque hinges, you can comfortably move between modes. Whether you need the keyboard for typing an essay, or prefer browsing social media on the sofa in tablet mode, you can write, research, shop, chat and browse the way you want. The touchscreen can be used in any mode, so that every website or app can be used with tap, swipe and hold gestures – just like a tablet or smartphone. Simply touch an app icon to open it, and navigate using taps, pinches and swipes. Made from premium aluminium, the Chromebook R11 is just 19.2 mm thin and weighs under 1.6 kg so that you can slip it into your bag easily. Everyday computing The Chromebook R 11 runs on Google Chrome OS - an easy-to-use operating system that gives you instant access to the internet, Cloud storage, emails and all your favourite Google Play apps. Chrome OS is optimised for Cloud connectivity, with everything you need stored online for maximum speed and efficiency. Built-in Cloud connectivity ensures your data is always backed up quickly online and accessible anywhere, anytime. Work all day Thanks to its impressive 9.5 battery life, the Chromebook R 11 can be used all day without the need to charge. You won't have the hassle of trying to find a power socket, allowing you to stay as productive as you need to be. Equipped with the fastest AC wireless connectivity as well as Bluetooth technology, you can easily stay online and connect to a range of devices without needing to fuss with any cables.
