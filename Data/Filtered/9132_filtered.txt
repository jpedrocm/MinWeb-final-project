I bought this laptop about a month ago, and after 4-5 days from the purchase day the graphics card went down, kept getting unresponsive and restarting - the screen goes black, and starts flashing! I talked to Lenovo, they said there's a serious problem with the graphics card, and I will get a new laptop. The new laptop arrived, and from the first boot for the new device, the same problem occurred: The graphic card went crazy, screen flashing, and the system restarted unexpectedly (Lost all the processes I was working on). I would attach a video, but I won't take the effort to upload it to YouTube first and then attach the link here. Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Actionthriller from Incredible performance for a home based system. I bought a Lenovo Ideapad 15" laptop three weeks ago. I'm totally pleased with the purchase and performance of this machine. From the attached pictures you can see I've made it the foundation of my home office. It has full HD, 16Gb of DDR4 Ram, 256 SSD, and a 1TB standard drive with Windows 10 as the OS. Everything I need. I love it! Great for work, writing, video, and gaming. When I go on the road I just disconnect and head to the airport. Gotta love Lenovo. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by Pixel Robot from Its fast, nice looking & affordable I was looking for a laptop that could handle all the task I needed to run like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects along with multi tab website browsing with chrome. This handles everything we throw at it, where as my previous laptop couldn't, the ssd on this loads and opens everything in lighting speeds. The backlit keyboard lets me work with low light with no problem. Overall very satisfied with the purchase. For being under 1K this seems to be a great buy for us. My sister bought one for my niece who is a light gamer after I praised about its price and features. My niece seems to love it so far!

I bought this laptop about a month ago, and after 4-5 days from the purchase day the graphics card went down, kept getting unresponsive and restarting - the screen goes black, and starts flashing! I talked to Lenovo, they said there's a serious problem with the graphics card, and I will get a new laptop. The new laptop arrived, and from the first boot for the new device, the same problem occurred: The graphic card went crazy, screen flashing, and the system restarted unexpectedly (Lost all the processes I was working on). I would attach a video, but I won't take the effort to upload it to YouTube first and then attach the link here. Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Actionthriller from Incredible performance for a home based system. I bought a Lenovo Ideapad 15" laptop three weeks ago. I'm totally pleased with the purchase and performance of this machine. From the attached pictures you can see I've made it the foundation of my home office. It has full HD, 16Gb of DDR4 Ram, 256 SSD, and a 1TB standard drive with Windows 10 as the OS. Everything I need. I love it! Great for work, writing, video, and gaming. When I go on the road I just disconnect and head to the airport. Gotta love Lenovo. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by Pixel Robot from Its fast, nice looking & affordable I was looking for a laptop that could handle all the task I needed to run like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects along with multi tab website browsing with chrome. This handles everything we throw at it, where as my previous laptop couldn't, the ssd on this loads and opens everything in lighting speeds. The backlit keyboard lets me work with low light with no problem. Overall very satisfied with the purchase. For being under 1K this seems to be a great buy for us. My sister bought one for my niece who is a light gamer after I praised about its price and features. My niece seems to love it so far!

Rated 1 out of 5 by Nissim from Poor hardware! I bought this laptop about a month ago, and after 4-5 days from the purchase day the graphics card went down, kept getting unresponsive and restarting - the screen goes black, and starts flashing! I talked to Lenovo, they said there's a serious problem with the graphics card, and I will get a new laptop. The new laptop arrived, and from the first boot for the new device, the same problem occurred: The graphic card went crazy, screen flashing, and the system restarted unexpectedly (Lost all the processes I was working on). I would attach a video, but I won't take the effort to upload it to YouTube first and then attach the link here. Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Actionthriller from Incredible performance for a home based system. I bought a Lenovo Ideapad 15" laptop three weeks ago. I'm totally pleased with the purchase and performance of this machine. From the attached pictures you can see I've made it the foundation of my home office. It has full HD, 16Gb of DDR4 Ram, 256 SSD, and a 1TB standard drive with Windows 10 as the OS. Everything I need. I love it! Great for work, writing, video, and gaming. When I go on the road I just disconnect and head to the airport. Gotta love Lenovo. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by Pixel Robot from Its fast, nice looking & affordable I was looking for a laptop that could handle all the task I needed to run like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects along with multi tab website browsing with chrome. This handles everything we throw at it, where as my previous laptop couldn't, the ssd on this loads and opens everything in lighting speeds. The backlit keyboard lets me work with low light with no problem. Overall very satisfied with the purchase. For being under 1K this seems to be a great buy for us. My sister bought one for my niece who is a light gamer after I praised about its price and features. My niece seems to love it so far!

Rated 1 out of 5 by Nissim from Poor hardware! I bought this laptop about a month ago, and after 4-5 days from the purchase day the graphics card went down, kept getting unresponsive and restarting - the screen goes black, and starts flashing! I talked to Lenovo, they said there's a serious problem with the graphics card, and I will get a new laptop.
