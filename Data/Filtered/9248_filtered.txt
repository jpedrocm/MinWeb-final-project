The machine itself is very nice, and I like the keyboard and the fact that it is back-lit is something I appreciate. The reason for giving it 3 stars and not 4.5 is because of the drivers. They simply does not work very well with this machine. The Back-lit keyboard is flashing like a florescent light that is about to die out, the Lenovo Settings app does NOT REMEMBER MY SETTINGS, so I can't reliably use the F1-F12 keys as function keys (should be the default behavior) and that makes working with software development a hasle as most functions in programs like Visual Studio is F1-F12 driven as hotkeys. Lenovo Settings keeps re-setting my function keys back to the alternative functions like adjusting volume, backlight etc, and this is VERY ANNOYING. Also the SDXC Card Reader keeps unmounting my SD cards in the middle of things, so that the files on the SD card gets unavailable. Given the small Hard Disk, I was planning on using a 128GB SD card to compensate for this, but this also gets impossible when it keeps ejecting my SD card without notice. THIS IS A SHAME! So, this was NOT the most positive review, but it is dead on honest. Date published: 2016-05-27 Rated 5 out of 5 by sarthak from Amazing Beast! I brought this laptop a month ago and I can't be more satisfied with my purchase. The boot time is in seconds thanks to the SSD. I would highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by RoamingPro from A real speed demon I purchased this laptop for a replacement for an old laptop running Windows Vista. This IdeaPad came with Windows 10, hybrid hard drive, core i7 processor with quad cores, DDR4 memory and FullHD 1920x1080 display. This laptop is so fast, it can handle anything I throw at it. I use it for photo editing, graphics design, and web development. It's the best investment I've made in a long time. Love it!!

The machine itself is very nice, and I like the keyboard and the fact that it is back-lit is something I appreciate. The reason for giving it 3 stars and not 4.5 is because of the drivers. They simply does not work very well with this machine. The Back-lit keyboard is flashing like a florescent light that is about to die out, the Lenovo Settings app does NOT REMEMBER MY SETTINGS, so I can't reliably use the F1-F12 keys as function keys (should be the default behavior) and that makes working with software development a hasle as most functions in programs like Visual Studio is F1-F12 driven as hotkeys. Lenovo Settings keeps re-setting my function keys back to the alternative functions like adjusting volume, backlight etc, and this is VERY ANNOYING. Also the SDXC Card Reader keeps unmounting my SD cards in the middle of things, so that the files on the SD card gets unavailable. Given the small Hard Disk, I was planning on using a 128GB SD card to compensate for this, but this also gets impossible when it keeps ejecting my SD card without notice. THIS IS A SHAME! So, this was NOT the most positive review, but it is dead on honest. Date published: 2016-05-27 Rated 5 out of 5 by sarthak from Amazing Beast! I brought this laptop a month ago and I can't be more satisfied with my purchase. The boot time is in seconds thanks to the SSD. I would highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by RoamingPro from A real speed demon I purchased this laptop for a replacement for an old laptop running Windows Vista. This IdeaPad came with Windows 10, hybrid hard drive, core i7 processor with quad cores, DDR4 memory and FullHD 1920x1080 display. This laptop is so fast, it can handle anything I throw at it. I use it for photo editing, graphics design, and web development. It's the best investment I've made in a long time. Love it!!

Is it a 2-in-1? Asked by: PaulK I have just had my laptop a coupe of weeks. It says it has a tablet mode and touch screen but I have been unable (have not spent the time yet) to figure out how to use it that way. Sorry probably not overly helpful. Other than that I absolutely love everything about it Answered by: paulpkc Date published: 2016-08-30 Hello, does this model comes with finger print reader.

Rated 3 out of 5 by cseder from Could have been better! The machine itself is very nice, and I like the keyboard and the fact that it is back-lit is something I appreciate. The reason for giving it 3 stars and not 4.5 is because of the drivers. They simply does not work very well with this machine. The Back-lit keyboard is flashing like a florescent light that is about to die out, the Lenovo Settings app does NOT REMEMBER MY SETTINGS, so I can't reliably use the F1-F12 keys as function keys (should be the default behavior) and that makes working with software development a hasle as most functions in programs like Visual Studio is F1-F12 driven as hotkeys. Lenovo Settings keeps re-setting my function keys back to the alternative functions like adjusting volume, backlight etc, and this is VERY ANNOYING. Also the SDXC Card Reader keeps unmounting my SD cards in the middle of things, so that the files on the SD card gets unavailable. Given the small Hard Disk, I was planning on using a 128GB SD card to compensate for this, but this also gets impossible when it keeps ejecting my SD card without notice. THIS IS A SHAME! So, this was NOT the most positive review, but it is dead on honest. Date published: 2016-05-27 Rated 5 out of 5 by sarthak from Amazing Beast! I brought this laptop a month ago and I can't be more satisfied with my purchase. The boot time is in seconds thanks to the SSD. I would highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by RoamingPro from A real speed demon I purchased this laptop for a replacement for an old laptop running Windows Vista. This IdeaPad came with Windows 10, hybrid hard drive, core i7 processor with quad cores, DDR4 memory and FullHD 1920x1080 display. This laptop is so fast, it can handle anything I throw at it. I use it for photo editing, graphics design, and web development. It's the best investment I've made in a long time. Love it!!

Does it have a touch screen? Is it a 2-in-1? Asked by: PaulK I have just had my laptop a coupe of weeks. It says it has a tablet mode and touch screen but I have been unable (have not spent the time yet) to figure out how to use it that way. Sorry probably not overly helpful. Other than that I absolutely love everything about it Answered by: paulpkc Date published: 2016-08-30 Hello, does this model comes with finger print reader.
