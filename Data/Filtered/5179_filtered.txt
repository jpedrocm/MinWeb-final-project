High-definition (HD) content required to view HD images. Available on select models. Memory Memory, also known as RAM, is your computer's workspace. It's what the computer uses to open and run programs. When you open an application, the computer moves it from the hard drive to RAM so you can get to work. The more work your computer is doing, the more space it needs. If you want to work with powerful applications like video editing software, or you like to multitask, it's always a good idea to opt for more RAM. Processor The processor is your computer's brain. Everything you do on your PC goes through the processor. It's where the computer gets the basic instructions it needs to get things done. A more powerful processor will let you work faster and more smoothly, especially for intensive tasks like video streaming. Graphics The computer's Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, determines how things look on-screen. Details like the screen resolution, response rate, and colors displayed are all determined by the GPU. Which GPU is for you? That depends on what you want to do. Photo and video editing will need a more powerful GPU than simply browsing the internet. Gamers also need more powerful GPUs to reduce lag time on game renders and enhance the overall gaming experience.

High-definition (HD) content required to view HD images. Available on select models. Memory Memory, also known as RAM, is your computer's workspace. It's what the computer uses to open and run programs. When you open an application, the computer moves it from the hard drive to RAM so you can get to work. The more work your computer is doing, the more space it needs. If you want to work with powerful applications like video editing software, or you like to multitask, it's always a good idea to opt for more RAM. Processor The processor is your computer's brain. Everything you do on your PC goes through the processor. It's where the computer gets the basic instructions it needs to get things done. A more powerful processor will let you work faster and more smoothly, especially for intensive tasks like video streaming. Graphics The computer's Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, determines how things look on-screen. Details like the screen resolution, response rate, and colors displayed are all determined by the GPU. Which GPU is for you? That depends on what you want to do. Photo and video editing will need a more powerful GPU than simply browsing the internet. Gamers also need more powerful GPUs to reduce lag time on game renders and enhance the overall gaming experience.

High-definition (HD) content required to view HD images. Available on select models. Memory Memory, also known as RAM, is your computer's workspace. It's what the computer uses to open and run programs. When you open an application, the computer moves it from the hard drive to RAM so you can get to work. The more work your computer is doing, the more space it needs. If you want to work with powerful applications like video editing software, or you like to multitask, it's always a good idea to opt for more RAM. Processor The processor is your computer's brain. Everything you do on your PC goes through the processor. It's where the computer gets the basic instructions it needs to get things done. A more powerful processor will let you work faster and more smoothly, especially for intensive tasks like video streaming. Graphics The computer's Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, determines how things look on-screen. Details like the screen resolution, response rate, and colors displayed are all determined by the GPU. Which GPU is for you? That depends on what you want to do. Photo and video editing will need a more powerful GPU than simply browsing the internet. Gamers also need more powerful GPUs to reduce lag time on game renders and enhance the overall gaming experience.

High-definition (HD) content required to view HD images. Available on select models. Memory Memory, also known as RAM, is your computer's workspace. It's what the computer uses to open and run programs. When you open an application, the computer moves it from the hard drive to RAM so you can get to work. The more work your computer is doing, the more space it needs. If you want to work with powerful applications like video editing software, or you like to multitask, it's always a good idea to opt for more RAM. Processor The processor is your computer's brain. Everything you do on your PC goes through the processor. It's where the computer gets the basic instructions it needs to get things done. A more powerful processor will let you work faster and more smoothly, especially for intensive tasks like video streaming. Graphics The computer's Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, determines how things look on-screen. Details like the screen resolution, response rate, and colors displayed are all determined by the GPU. Which GPU is for you? That depends on what you want to do. Photo and video editing will need a more powerful GPU than simply browsing the internet. Gamers also need more powerful GPUs to reduce lag time on game renders and enhance the overall gaming experience.

Memory Memory, also known as RAM, is your computer's workspace. It's what the computer uses to open and run programs. When you open an application, the computer moves it from the hard drive to RAM so you can get to work. The more work your computer is doing, the more space it needs. If you want to work with powerful applications like video editing software, or you like to multitask, it's always a good idea to opt for more RAM. Processor The processor is your computer's brain. Everything you do on your PC goes through the processor. It's where the computer gets the basic instructions it needs to get things done. A more powerful processor will let you work faster and more smoothly, especially for intensive tasks like video streaming. Graphics The computer's Graphics Processing Unit, or GPU, determines how things look on-screen. Details like the screen resolution, response rate, and colors displayed are all determined by the GPU. Which GPU is for you? That depends on what you want to do. Photo and video editing will need a more powerful GPU than simply browsing the internet. Gamers also need more powerful GPUs to reduce lag time on game renders and enhance the overall gaming experience.
