Intel® Core™ i7 Processor The GP72 6QF boasts the latest 6th generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor, consuming less power but delivering even better performance than previous i7 processors, capable of running up to 20% faster under average use. This results in smoother, faster and more enjoyable gameplay as you know the processor will keep up with your demands. Fast gameplay With 8 GB DDR4-2133 memory support, you can enjoy a fast performance that will allow you to immerse yourself in your gaming experience. You can even expand the memory capacity up to a maximum of 64 GB for truly breath-taking gameplay. A 1 TB HDD ensures that there is plenty of storage space on the laptop for your games and files, while the SSD optimises the hardware and software. This helps to boost the speed your games run at to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. Cooler Boost technology boosts the airflow to keep the laptop and chipsets at a lower temperature, allowing you to play for hours without worrying about overheating. Plus the Killer E2400 chipset protects network traffic and prevents lag spikes to ensure a fast and smooth gaming experience. Connectivity The  GP72 6QF features an HDMI port and a Mini DisplayPort, as well as a USB 3.0 slot. There is also a USB-C port which utilises Thunderbolt 3, making it capable of transferring massive files quickly and efficiently with up 40 Gbps transfer rates. You can also immerse yourself in your gaming experience by connecting up to three external displays in Full HD with MSI Matrix Display technology. It is even possible to enjoy 4k outputs with screens capable of boasting a resolution up to 3840 x 2160 (sold separately).

The high quality sound technology of the GP72 6QF brings games to life. Nahimic technology offers virtual 7.1 surround sound in immersive high definition.
