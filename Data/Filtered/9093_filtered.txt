I have been using the Chromebook 13 (i3 6100, 1920 x 1080 IPS) for about three weeks now. The build quality is characteristic of the Thinkpad line of products; the keyboard is second to none and is a pure joy to type on for extensive periods of time. The screen hinges also feel very sturdy and durable. I primarily use the device with headphones so I cannot comment on the quality of the speakers as a previous reviewer has noted. I have been mainly using the device for web development, running Linux Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. The fan does kick in while running both Linux and ChromeOS but is still not very loud nor does it produce much heat. Great laptop so far! Date published: 2016-08-14 Rated 1 out of 5 by Zollern from The Worst Speakers Ever After waiting about 3 Weeks for this Chromebook ........I have been using this chrome book for about 2 Weeks my biggest issue is that and the Audio is Horrible the speakers are so bad you can not hear videos at MAX audio output.. So if you want this product BEWARE the Audio is a serious issue. I am sure Lenovo will offer a replacement but waiting an other three weeks for a replacement is ridiculous as this product was shipped from Shanghai China. The Battery Life is really good I would only recommended this product if you do not mind pretending to be hard of hearing (deaf) as you can not watch media on this product due to Speaker and Audio Issues. Date published: 2016-08-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Connc from Two thumbs up Lightweight and easy to take everywhere I go, and is also able to easily handle everything I do on it. I'm a college student so I do all my projects on it, and also work some of the time from my laptop and it hasn't definitely exceeded my expectations.

I have been using the Chromebook 13 (i3 6100, 1920 x 1080 IPS) for about three weeks now. The build quality is characteristic of the Thinkpad line of products; the keyboard is second to none and is a pure joy to type on for extensive periods of time. The screen hinges also feel very sturdy and durable. I primarily use the device with headphones so I cannot comment on the quality of the speakers as a previous reviewer has noted. I have been mainly using the device for web development, running Linux Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. The fan does kick in while running both Linux and ChromeOS but is still not very loud nor does it produce much heat. Great laptop so far! Date published: 2016-08-14 Rated 1 out of 5 by Zollern from The Worst Speakers Ever After waiting about 3 Weeks for this Chromebook ........I have been using this chrome book for about 2 Weeks my biggest issue is that and the Audio is Horrible the speakers are so bad you can not hear videos at MAX audio output.. So if you want this product BEWARE the Audio is a serious issue. I am sure Lenovo will offer a replacement but waiting an other three weeks for a replacement is ridiculous as this product was shipped from Shanghai China. The Battery Life is really good I would only recommended this product if you do not mind pretending to be hard of hearing (deaf) as you can not watch media on this product due to Speaker and Audio Issues. Date published: 2016-08-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Connc from Two thumbs up Lightweight and easy to take everywhere I go, and is also able to easily handle everything I do on it. I'm a college student so I do all my projects on it, and also work some of the time from my laptop and it hasn't definitely exceeded my expectations.

Approximately how long will it take to be released? Asked by: mentos Multi-touch will be be available for all configurations, not just high-end.

Optional FHD (1920x1080) IPS Display Configure your Chromebook with an FHD anti-glare display with In-Plane Switching (IPS), and enjoy a premium visual experience. IPS technology allows for vivid colors and nearly 180-degree viewing angles. Add a touch panel (coming soon) for enhanced navigation and impeccable response time. Tested to Military Specifications Military-specification testing validates the ruggedness, durability, and quality of this Chromebook by conducting 12 tests. Integrated 720p HD Webcam & Dual Noise-Cancelling Microphones Enjoy superior web conferencing on your Chromebook, which includes a low-light sensitive 720p HD webcam with wide-angle viewing and face-tracking, dual noise-cancelling microphones with configurations for crystal-clear private and conference mode VoIP meetings, plus, convenient multimedia keys for quick and easy access to microphone, speaker, and camera controls.

Rated 5 out of 5 by cdroberts76 from Best Chromebook I've owned. I have been using the Chromebook 13 (i3 6100, 1920 x 1080 IPS) for about three weeks now. The build quality is characteristic of the Thinkpad line of products; the keyboard is second to none and is a pure joy to type on for extensive periods of time. The screen hinges also feel very sturdy and durable. I primarily use the device with headphones so I cannot comment on the quality of the speakers as a previous reviewer has noted. I have been mainly using the device for web development, running Linux Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. The fan does kick in while running both Linux and ChromeOS but is still not very loud nor does it produce much heat. Great laptop so far! Date published: 2016-08-14 Rated 1 out of 5 by Zollern from The Worst Speakers Ever After waiting about 3 Weeks for this Chromebook ........I have been using this chrome book for about 2 Weeks my biggest issue is that and the Audio is Horrible the speakers are so bad you can not hear videos at MAX audio output.. So if you want this product BEWARE the Audio is a serious issue. I am sure Lenovo will offer a replacement but waiting an other three weeks for a replacement is ridiculous as this product was shipped from Shanghai China. The Battery Life is really good I would only recommended this product if you do not mind pretending to be hard of hearing (deaf) as you can not watch media on this product due to Speaker and Audio Issues. Date published: 2016-08-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Connc from Two thumbs up Lightweight and easy to take everywhere I go, and is also able to easily handle everything I do on it. I'm a college student so I do all my projects on it, and also work some of the time from my laptop and it hasn't definitely exceeded my expectations.
