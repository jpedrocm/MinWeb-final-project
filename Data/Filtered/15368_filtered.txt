Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles 2 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 10 Product information Enjoy stunning visuals and performance with the 2015 Apple MacBook Pro 15" with Retina Display. Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Enjoy stunning visuals and performance with the 2015 Apple MacBook Pro 15" with Retina Display. Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Enjoy stunning visuals and performance with the 2015 Apple MacBook Pro 15" with Retina Display. Retina display Over 5 million pixels make up the unique 15.4” Retina display for a remarkably detailed and vivid picture - ideal for editing photos or watching HD movies. Even text is razor sharp, making everyday tasks such as web browsing and typing documents clearer than ever. The 2800 x 1800 resolution is complimented by Intel's Iris Pro Graphics, which deliver the performance of a dedicated graphics card without the increased power consumption or heat. High-performance processing From graphic design and music production to everyday essays and browsing, the MacBook Pro delivers seriously high-performance computing thanks to the Intel® Core™ i7 processor. With exclusive Intel® technology, a high clock speed and quad-core architecture, it runs the most demanding creative software with ease. Intel® and AMD graphics With combined Intel and AMD graphics technology, the MacBook Pro with Retina delivers superior visuals. The Intel® Iris® Pro embedded graphics card features 128MB of embedded memory, which accelerates intensive tasks by acting as an ultra-fast cache. The dedicated Radeon R9 M370X GPU features 2GB of ultra fast GDDR5 memory and is packed with top of the range technology to ensure greater speed and dazzling graphics when you're editing photos or playing games. Cutting-edge storage Storage comes courtesy of a 512 GB solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than normal hard drives, SSDs enable your MacBook Pro to boot in seconds and load demanding programs quickly and efficiently. They're also much thinner than normal hard drives, which is one of the reasons the MacBook Pro manages to be so thin, despite its performance capabilities. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
