I really love this. Date published: 2016-07-31 Rated 3 out of 5 by Anil24 from Save for a Thinkpad A longtime Lenovo customer, I recently decided to replace my ancient Thinkpad with another Lenovo. This time, as a way to save a little money, I opted for the Ideapad 510-15SK [Intel i5-6100]. A more detailed review follows, but I wish that I had waited, and saved up for a Thinkpad. The Ideapads aren't much cheaper than the Thinkpads, and at the end of the day, Thinkpad quality trumps these average quality Ideapads. Pros: -INSTALL: There is little bloatware -DISPLAY: Nice sharp screen with vibrant colors -KEYBOARD: Keyboard is membrane, but feels good to type on -KEYBOARD COVER: The metal keyboard cover and frame around the screen feel sturdy Cons: (alas there are many) -DURABILITY: This is _my fault_ but I wrongly assumed that all Lenovo laptops came with the hard drive protection and spill-proof keyboards that the Thinkpads have. The Ideapads do not. This laptop does not have near the durability of the Thinkpad. -BUILD: The metal face on the keyboard and screen feel sturdy, but everything else seems flimsy. The external case (by this I mean the plastic back, or top of the laptop when the screen is closed) seems exceptionally flimsy. -SPEED: I expected a PC that was a bit more snappy. It's not terribly fast, and the Hard drive (5400RPM) seems really slow. -FAN: There seems to be a cooling fan that is ALWAYS on. It's not super-loud, but it's loud enough that it's slightly distracting and will take some getting used to. (This is personal preference, but my point of comparison is the super-silent old Thinkpad that I have.) -BATTERY: The battery cannot be removed from the PC!!!! I've never seen this before. This means that when/if it dies and needs to be replaced, I presume I'll be paying a pretty penny to have the PC serviced.This doesn't seem to be noted anywhere on the Product guide online -WEIGHT/GIRTH: The dimensions of the laptop are clearly listed. It's big and heavy. This is a system that really only works for the home user who occasionally might take the laptop to another room. It's not the type of machine that one can throw into a backpack and travel with. (Not only because of size/weight, but also perceived sturdiness.) Final comments: I paid less for an Ideapad and thought that I was getting more by going for an i5 processor than the nearest similarly priced Thinkpad, which has an i3. I've only realized after the fact, that the i3 and i5 (laptop processors) are almost exactly the same, except that the i5 overclocks and runs a bit faster when more speed is needed. This makes little difference to most users. If I could return this, I would. But I've already installed software on it, and I presume that Lenovo would not take the return (and then there's a 15% restocking fee). Date published: 2016-06-29 Rated 4 out of 5 by Bijit from Comes with good features I bought this on this July & I'm pretty much happy, but the only thing which I didn't like about this machine is that it doesn't have Type C port. Date published: 2016-09-09 Rated 3 out of 5 by fsha from getting used to it I've had this laptop for about a month and it's taking some getting used to. The half sized shift key is a real problem-- I'm going to have to reprogram the pgup to shift if I'm ever going to be productive. The battery life is not as good as I was expecting it to be, and the program that tells you how much you have left isn't linear...the last three hours vanish in about 30 minutes. (I'm using Ubuntu linux...so that may be the problem). The wireless, billed as especially good, does not pick up a signal as well as my old lenovo thinkpad did. Otherwise, adequate. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by leftfieldhero from Solid offering, decent features for the price. What's great: Backlight keyboard, Screen looks nice, my model had 12 GB DDR4 which was plenty. I also had a 1 TB 5400 RPM hard drive which gave plenty of space, speakers were fair for a laptop. The trackpad was big and responsive. Nice weight for the size. What I'd like better: The backlight for the keyboard has two options. On or off. The trackpad would have been nice to have the buttons as a part of the pad. Theres just a little too much flex everywhere, the screen and base for my liking but i suppose this is a trade off for the nice weight. In the end: I was hoping this would suit my needs but I think it's just a little too big and I'm afraid a little to fragile for life with me an I'll be returning it but I'm not sad or disappointed I tried it and really it's no fault of the machine's just my preference. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Nath98 from Great features! Bought this 3 months ago, works extremely fast. Bios lasts about 3 seconds, highly recommend, very fast and light weight laptop. Decent but battery life as well, looks very modern though, interface is kinda sloppy and very wide, gamers will have trouble since keys are spread out making it harder to click, but overall laptops ace, 10/10 Date published: 2016-10-14 Rated 3 out of 5 by engdahl from Nonstandard keyboard layout Great specs for a great price, however, if you touch-type I would suggest a Thinkpad with a standard keyboard layout instead. After a couple days getting used to the Ideapad we realized that the reason we were making so many typing errors is that the right shift key has moved to the right. The up-arrow is where you would expect the shift key to be. This is a huge design flaw, and defeats touch-typists. One other possible problem is the sharp edge at the front where your wrist will rest. This should have been rounded and smooth. Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by disappointed in nj from Disappointed First, I paid an extra $20 for expedited delivery. Got it 15 days after I ordered, and they didn't include the full shipping address so I had to pick the thing up from UPS. I agree with other reviewers that the laptop feels and is a bit flimsy, the shift key on the right side isn't in the standard position (why would they do that?), I've been on the laptop for less than hour and it's hot to the touch, and the speed seems very slow. Don't buy this machine. Date published: 2016-07-20 Rated 3 out of 5 by kenbh from Nice Laptop! I bought this a month ago to replace a machine destroyed by lightening. It is relatively fast computer with good features. The screen is wonderfully bright and clear with full-HD resolution. With only 3 USB ports I have purchased a separate hub to handle peripherals. The keyboard has a good feel to it, and the separate number pad was a selling point, but I am making more mistakes in typing with this keyboard so key placement must be a little different from my previous machine. The audio system and Dolby application work well when using the computer speakers but the quality is awful when connected to an outside system. The computer is light-weight with a slim profile. Overall this is a solid computer for the price, but a few minor modifications would make it exceptional. Date published: 2016-08-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by hrxnowak from Laptop is fantastic/charger cord sucks The laptop itself is great. Fast and fun additives like the light up keyboard. Fast start up, and bright screen. My one and only problem is the horrific charger cord. Its a fat box on the end where it plugs in, followed by short cord to computer itself. Problem lies in any movement of cord. Due to the heavy base where it plugs in, it constantly falls out of the plug in. Needs to be fixed. Oh and the mouse click button takes a long time to get used to. Not easy to scroll and click. Date published: 2016-10-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Kathy67 from New laptop Love it! Works like a charm. Great replacement for my very old computer. Date published: 2016-07-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by nycbauer from Works Great I have been using this for a few weeks, and I have been very happy with the performance. It starts up quickly, runs fast, and the battery life is very good (I've only once had to run to plug it in when I forgot to charge it the night before after using it throughout the day). The screen is fantastic, the resolution is great, and very clear. I have only two pet peeves with it. 1) the keyboard layout is a little weird. Since it's a full keyboard (a big plus for that) they had to stick the right shift button among the directional keys, so I frequently end up hitting the up key instead of the shift. the second is that when I've attached external monitors to it, the text is a little fuzzy. It could be a setting I'm missing, but I've tried different monitors on the different ports with different settings. Date published: 2016-10-09 Rated 1 out of 5 by ViolinJ from Keyboard doesn't work, but cannot return it. The key "J" on the Keyboard doesn't work, but cannot return it. How can I exchange a new one? Date published: 2016-06-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by alwayswright145 from Great little machine! I use this for business and pleasure, accounting and writing, FB and e-mail. I love the wide screen and the accounting pad. I love the Windows 10 operating system and the notifications tab. The only thing I'd change on this is the location of the right hand shift button and the Page Up button. I'd reverse them, as they are constantly messing up my typing. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Lear from Great features and performance I was looking for a laptop that was fast and had many features. I was not disappointed with the IdeaPad 510. Clicking and starting anything opens almost instantaneously. I am able to get so much more done in my day and I am not frustrated waiting and waiting. It is light weight and easy to take where ever I need to go. I don't go anywhere without it. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by CustomerUA from Lenovo 510 15ISK 80SR00DJRA review I bought this a month ago... specially choose the model with minimum characteristics (4Gb\500Gb\No ODD) to define in work process what components should I upgrade and what should I leave intact. I've played some games with 4Gb onboard memory and have no problems with games like [World of Tanks\World of Warships] but [The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt] save game load time was about 5-8 minutes depends of scene details. Personal chest worked extremly slow (12 sec for moving 1 thing). So I've decided to upgrade system memory. In official datasheets there is a limit for 12 Gb maximum memory, but I decided to have a risk and install 16 Gb memory module which is extremly cheap in my region (TED416G2400C16-S01). It's working nice and finally my 510 has 20Gb of memory. [Witcher 3] save game load became much shorter - less then 60 sec., but personal chest are still slow-working. As for the graphics memory - that is slow DDR-3 standard, but there is no need to use quick one because of memory bandwidth is 64 bit. As for support in my region - there are no direct contacts to support team (that is bad), just the society forum of owners, but in other side - you can find info on every spare part used in manufacturing whith detailed photos of them (in official site - partslookup) - that is great. *Advantages* 1. 16 Gb memory modules could be installed. 2. IPS screen. 3. A lot of actual technologies (aug 2016). 4. Additional S(H)DD could be installed in yhe slot of ODD. 5. Could install\change memory\hdd\battery in 60 sec. without loosing warranty (removable covers). 6. Full-size keyboard with numpad and lithings. 7. Good price\quality rating (another manufacturers could not suggest any model with IPS screen for that price in my region). *Disadvanteges* 1. The only memory slot and 1 module is onboard, so different sized modules are working in one-channel mode 2. If you need an OS another then Win 10 you should have some experience in solvig such promlems (preformatting disk with another utility, copiyng 510 drivers to that disk part, then installing OS, pre-implementing USB 3 drivers in distributive, and than using drivers from that specially created disk partition). 3. Extremly loud signal when plugging to charger (I coul not found how to turn off this *pity feature*) is inconvinient at night time. 4. For BIOS menu entering or loading from external drive you shold use paper clip (the hole at left side of laptop). 5. Full HD for the 15.6" screen size could be difficult to manage in some programs (especially when you are connecting to another PC via RDP) 6. Keyboard [Right Shift] and [Up Arrow] have inconvinient interposition. 7. Laptop W-dimention have the maximum size for 15.6" devices and you could have some troubles whith your previous bag for the device of such form-factor. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Tomcat10 from Great value I purchased model 80SR001FUS. It has all the features I wanted at a very reasonable price. I have used Lenovo products since their purchase of IBM's equipment line and have never had an issue. My only complaints are the lack of a docking device and the power connector, it is somewhat chintzy compared to the T and X lines.. Date published: 2016-09-28 Rated 5 out of 5 by Steven B from Simple, fast, focus! Working with this Ideapad for a month now. As with all new things, it's always getting used to it. For me f.e. the short Shift on the right :) Overall I am very satisfied, esp. with the SSD. Wondering why there is a 'sleep' mode on this piece. It is so fast. Perfect sound and display. Date published: 2016-09-05 Rated 5 out of 5 by JillP from Love it! I enjoy my Lenovo laptop enormously. It's a convenient size to use either on my lap or on a table. It's bright and very easy to see in all lights and had loads of features that I'm still discovering. I'm not crazy over Windows 10, but am adapting. It's very easy to setup and use. Date published: 2016-07-12 Rated 2 out of 5 by Rolskie from Not that impressive... I bought this laptop more than a month ago and I am disappointed because it's not that fast as I expect it to be with its Intel i7 quad core processor. Another thing is its keyboard which is too cramped. It would have been better if they took away the numbers keys. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Yorch1979 from Great Laptop i bought this machine a month ago.im happy with it. so far so good. it delivers the goods it advertises. haven't tested the full i7 processor yet, but im sure there will be no issues.

Date published: 2016-07-31 Rated 5 out of 5 by shab19863232 from Great Laptop for a Reasonable price I wanted to know is the ram upgradable? from 8gb to 16gb? Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 4 out of 5 by Bcosta86 from Fast and sleek machine This has been a great computer so far. Love the display. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Eternal Bullfrog from Does everything it promises, and more! Let me start by saying I bought this laptop to be, well, a laptop. I wanted a general high quality machine with decent performance levels to function as my primary home computer. And Lenovo delivered! The customization options available were not extensive for this particular model, but certainly more than enough for the average user. I went for the i7-6500 (dual core) CPU, integrated graphics(Intel HD 520), 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration. I'm no expert, so this review is from the perspective of a general user. Overall performance 5/5 Usage is mainly for Office programs, internet, games and a few specialized analysis programs like R and PRAAT Speed 5/5 Pretty good for all standard programs, and quite phenomenal for data-heavy PRAAT programs (at least when comparing to our older dual core Intel desktops) Graphics 4.5/5 Occasionally glitches while playing Skyrim but is doing incredibly well for general use, movies, streaming, lower configuration video games etc. Noise level 5/5 Can barely hear it at its loudest Portability 5/5 I may be behind the times here, but my previous laptop was monster compared to the 5 lb slimness that this machine is Maintenance 4/5 No hatch, and a non-removable battery. But I'm told this actually allows for larger power capacities, so I'm not complaining too much. Battery 5/5 At least so far (1month in) no issues and battery life is true to description at 4-5 hours with standard usage In short, good machine for the price, perfect for average use and even a little bit of data-heavy coding. Can't speak for support since I haven't needed it yet. So far, I love it!

Asked by: gunungapi Yes it does come with a free year's subscription. We Uninstaller it in favor of another Antivirus program though. Answered by: Limitchell Date published: 2016-08-28 Is the ram upgradable from 8gb to 16gb? Asked by: shab19863232 4GB of RAM is soldered to the systemboard. An 8GB stick can be added to the additional slot for a total of 12GB maximum. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-08-18 Am I able to use a docking station with this model? New to docking so am unsure if this is a standard feature or not. Thanks! Asked by: Dougedug No. This is a low end laptop and doesn't have that feature, but you really don't need it. I use a 4 port USB 3.0 hub that I connect an external mouse keyboard and whatever else I need to that and then just connect the hub to this. The Good: This is the cheapest brand name laptop I found that has a 1080p screen and has dual video outputs (VGA and HDMI, so I'm able to get a triple monitor setup with this). The system is also easily upgradeable with an SSD and more memory. The Bad: The keyboard and trackpad are horrendous. The up arrow key is next to the ?/ key and the right shift is to the right of the up arrow key! The designer/engineer who thought of this should have to use this type of keyboard for the rest of their lives as punishment (I will be afflicted with it for the next few years since I'm not buying another one for another 5 years and will watch out for this in the future!). I had to remap my keys in the OS and put masking tape over the keys! The two buttons on the touchpad can only be clicked at the very far right and left edges of the right and left buttons respectively. The middle and left/right areas of the right and left buttons respectively are not clickable. They also make a really loud clicking noise that sounds like a mouse from the 90's, you're pretty much stuck with using tap to click/drag on the touchpad. A DVD drive? Really? People are still stuck in the last decade I guess. Should have made the laptop thinner and lighter by not including that. The CPU fan is loud even when the system is idling and it's brand new, there's no dust in my air conditioned environment and the ambient temp is ~75F. I also dug into lm_sensors and the CPU fan speed is not controllable in this model, shame. Finally the screen is a gigantic 15.6", The 14" screen should be cheaper but it's more expensive. Economies of scale, no clue why the demand for 15.6" screens would be higher. Answered by: sabujp Date published: 2016-09-23 I would like some clarification on the Primary memory upgrade (RAM). This model comes in 8 and 4GB of Ram. The question was answered. Stating the RAM is soldered into the board. There is clearly an access panel for HDD and RAM access.Can you upgrade RAM?

Asked by: kasturi 12GB max Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-10-03 how do i replace the battery? Asked by: edu_casal You don't easily. If that's something I would have looked at in more depth (that and the keyboard layout), I probably would not have purchased this laptop. Here are instructions for how to do it (see the picture at the very bottom): https://electro-medical.blogspot.com/2016/04/lenovo-ideapad-510-disassembling.html . Basically you have to take out all the screws from the bottom of the laptop, which then allows you to remove the cover holding the keyboard and you get to it from the top. This is really meant to be a throwaway laptop for most people.

I really love this. Date published: 2016-07-31 Rated 3 out of 5 by Anil24 from Save for a Thinkpad A longtime Lenovo customer, I recently decided to replace my ancient Thinkpad with another Lenovo. This time, as a way to save a little money, I opted for the Ideapad 510-15SK [Intel i5-6100]. A more detailed review follows, but I wish that I had waited, and saved up for a Thinkpad. The Ideapads aren't much cheaper than the Thinkpads, and at the end of the day, Thinkpad quality trumps these average quality Ideapads. Pros: -INSTALL: There is little bloatware -DISPLAY: Nice sharp screen with vibrant colors -KEYBOARD: Keyboard is membrane, but feels good to type on -KEYBOARD COVER: The metal keyboard cover and frame around the screen feel sturdy Cons: (alas there are many) -DURABILITY: This is _my fault_ but I wrongly assumed that all Lenovo laptops came with the hard drive protection and spill-proof keyboards that the Thinkpads have. The Ideapads do not. This laptop does not have near the durability of the Thinkpad. -BUILD: The metal face on the keyboard and screen feel sturdy, but everything else seems flimsy. The external case (by this I mean the plastic back, or top of the laptop when the screen is closed) seems exceptionally flimsy. -SPEED: I expected a PC that was a bit more snappy. It's not terribly fast, and the Hard drive (5400RPM) seems really slow. -FAN: There seems to be a cooling fan that is ALWAYS on. It's not super-loud, but it's loud enough that it's slightly distracting and will take some getting used to. (This is personal preference, but my point of comparison is the super-silent old Thinkpad that I have.) -BATTERY: The battery cannot be removed from the PC!!!! I've never seen this before. This means that when/if it dies and needs to be replaced, I presume I'll be paying a pretty penny to have the PC serviced.This doesn't seem to be noted anywhere on the Product guide online -WEIGHT/GIRTH: The dimensions of the laptop are clearly listed. It's big and heavy. This is a system that really only works for the home user who occasionally might take the laptop to another room. It's not the type of machine that one can throw into a backpack and travel with. (Not only because of size/weight, but also perceived sturdiness.) Final comments: I paid less for an Ideapad and thought that I was getting more by going for an i5 processor than the nearest similarly priced Thinkpad, which has an i3. I've only realized after the fact, that the i3 and i5 (laptop processors) are almost exactly the same, except that the i5 overclocks and runs a bit faster when more speed is needed. This makes little difference to most users. If I could return this, I would. But I've already installed software on it, and I presume that Lenovo would not take the return (and then there's a 15% restocking fee). Date published: 2016-06-29 Rated 4 out of 5 by Bijit from Comes with good features I bought this on this July & I'm pretty much happy, but the only thing which I didn't like about this machine is that it doesn't have Type C port. Date published: 2016-09-09 Rated 3 out of 5 by fsha from getting used to it I've had this laptop for about a month and it's taking some getting used to. The half sized shift key is a real problem-- I'm going to have to reprogram the pgup to shift if I'm ever going to be productive. The battery life is not as good as I was expecting it to be, and the program that tells you how much you have left isn't linear...the last three hours vanish in about 30 minutes. (I'm using Ubuntu linux...so that may be the problem). The wireless, billed as especially good, does not pick up a signal as well as my old lenovo thinkpad did. Otherwise, adequate. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by leftfieldhero from Solid offering, decent features for the price. What's great: Backlight keyboard, Screen looks nice, my model had 12 GB DDR4 which was plenty. I also had a 1 TB 5400 RPM hard drive which gave plenty of space, speakers were fair for a laptop. The trackpad was big and responsive. Nice weight for the size. What I'd like better: The backlight for the keyboard has two options. On or off. The trackpad would have been nice to have the buttons as a part of the pad. Theres just a little too much flex everywhere, the screen and base for my liking but i suppose this is a trade off for the nice weight. In the end: I was hoping this would suit my needs but I think it's just a little too big and I'm afraid a little to fragile for life with me an I'll be returning it but I'm not sad or disappointed I tried it and really it's no fault of the machine's just my preference. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Nath98 from Great features! Bought this 3 months ago, works extremely fast. Bios lasts about 3 seconds, highly recommend, very fast and light weight laptop. Decent but battery life as well, looks very modern though, interface is kinda sloppy and very wide, gamers will have trouble since keys are spread out making it harder to click, but overall laptops ace, 10/10 Date published: 2016-10-14 Rated 3 out of 5 by engdahl from Nonstandard keyboard layout Great specs for a great price, however, if you touch-type I would suggest a Thinkpad with a standard keyboard layout instead. After a couple days getting used to the Ideapad we realized that the reason we were making so many typing errors is that the right shift key has moved to the right. The up-arrow is where you would expect the shift key to be. This is a huge design flaw, and defeats touch-typists. One other possible problem is the sharp edge at the front where your wrist will rest. This should have been rounded and smooth. Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by disappointed in nj from Disappointed First, I paid an extra $20 for expedited delivery. Got it 15 days after I ordered, and they didn't include the full shipping address so I had to pick the thing up from UPS. I agree with other reviewers that the laptop feels and is a bit flimsy, the shift key on the right side isn't in the standard position (why would they do that?), I've been on the laptop for less than hour and it's hot to the touch, and the speed seems very slow. Don't buy this machine. Date published: 2016-07-20 Rated 3 out of 5 by kenbh from Nice Laptop! I bought this a month ago to replace a machine destroyed by lightening. It is relatively fast computer with good features. The screen is wonderfully bright and clear with full-HD resolution. With only 3 USB ports I have purchased a separate hub to handle peripherals. The keyboard has a good feel to it, and the separate number pad was a selling point, but I am making more mistakes in typing with this keyboard so key placement must be a little different from my previous machine. The audio system and Dolby application work well when using the computer speakers but the quality is awful when connected to an outside system. The computer is light-weight with a slim profile. Overall this is a solid computer for the price, but a few minor modifications would make it exceptional. Date published: 2016-08-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by hrxnowak from Laptop is fantastic/charger cord sucks The laptop itself is great. Fast and fun additives like the light up keyboard. Fast start up, and bright screen. My one and only problem is the horrific charger cord. Its a fat box on the end where it plugs in, followed by short cord to computer itself. Problem lies in any movement of cord. Due to the heavy base where it plugs in, it constantly falls out of the plug in. Needs to be fixed. Oh and the mouse click button takes a long time to get used to. Not easy to scroll and click. Date published: 2016-10-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Kathy67 from New laptop Love it! Works like a charm. Great replacement for my very old computer. Date published: 2016-07-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by nycbauer from Works Great I have been using this for a few weeks, and I have been very happy with the performance. It starts up quickly, runs fast, and the battery life is very good (I've only once had to run to plug it in when I forgot to charge it the night before after using it throughout the day). The screen is fantastic, the resolution is great, and very clear. I have only two pet peeves with it. 1) the keyboard layout is a little weird. Since it's a full keyboard (a big plus for that) they had to stick the right shift button among the directional keys, so I frequently end up hitting the up key instead of the shift. the second is that when I've attached external monitors to it, the text is a little fuzzy. It could be a setting I'm missing, but I've tried different monitors on the different ports with different settings. Date published: 2016-10-09 Rated 1 out of 5 by ViolinJ from Keyboard doesn't work, but cannot return it. The key "J" on the Keyboard doesn't work, but cannot return it. How can I exchange a new one? Date published: 2016-06-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by alwayswright145 from Great little machine! I use this for business and pleasure, accounting and writing, FB and e-mail. I love the wide screen and the accounting pad. I love the Windows 10 operating system and the notifications tab. The only thing I'd change on this is the location of the right hand shift button and the Page Up button. I'd reverse them, as they are constantly messing up my typing. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Lear from Great features and performance I was looking for a laptop that was fast and had many features. I was not disappointed with the IdeaPad 510. Clicking and starting anything opens almost instantaneously. I am able to get so much more done in my day and I am not frustrated waiting and waiting. It is light weight and easy to take where ever I need to go. I don't go anywhere without it. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by CustomerUA from Lenovo 510 15ISK 80SR00DJRA review I bought this a month ago... specially choose the model with minimum characteristics (4Gb\500Gb\No ODD) to define in work process what components should I upgrade and what should I leave intact. I've played some games with 4Gb onboard memory and have no problems with games like [World of Tanks\World of Warships] but [The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt] save game load time was about 5-8 minutes depends of scene details. Personal chest worked extremly slow (12 sec for moving 1 thing). So I've decided to upgrade system memory. In official datasheets there is a limit for 12 Gb maximum memory, but I decided to have a risk and install 16 Gb memory module which is extremly cheap in my region (TED416G2400C16-S01). It's working nice and finally my 510 has 20Gb of memory. [Witcher 3] save game load became much shorter - less then 60 sec., but personal chest are still slow-working. As for the graphics memory - that is slow DDR-3 standard, but there is no need to use quick one because of memory bandwidth is 64 bit. As for support in my region - there are no direct contacts to support team (that is bad), just the society forum of owners, but in other side - you can find info on every spare part used in manufacturing whith detailed photos of them (in official site - partslookup) - that is great. *Advantages* 1. 16 Gb memory modules could be installed. 2. IPS screen. 3. A lot of actual technologies (aug 2016). 4. Additional S(H)DD could be installed in yhe slot of ODD. 5. Could install\change memory\hdd\battery in 60 sec. without loosing warranty (removable covers). 6. Full-size keyboard with numpad and lithings. 7. Good price\quality rating (another manufacturers could not suggest any model with IPS screen for that price in my region). *Disadvanteges* 1. The only memory slot and 1 module is onboard, so different sized modules are working in one-channel mode 2. If you need an OS another then Win 10 you should have some experience in solvig such promlems (preformatting disk with another utility, copiyng 510 drivers to that disk part, then installing OS, pre-implementing USB 3 drivers in distributive, and than using drivers from that specially created disk partition). 3. Extremly loud signal when plugging to charger (I coul not found how to turn off this *pity feature*) is inconvinient at night time. 4. For BIOS menu entering or loading from external drive you shold use paper clip (the hole at left side of laptop). 5. Full HD for the 15.6" screen size could be difficult to manage in some programs (especially when you are connecting to another PC via RDP) 6. Keyboard [Right Shift] and [Up Arrow] have inconvinient interposition. 7. Laptop W-dimention have the maximum size for 15.6" devices and you could have some troubles whith your previous bag for the device of such form-factor. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Tomcat10 from Great value I purchased model 80SR001FUS. It has all the features I wanted at a very reasonable price. I have used Lenovo products since their purchase of IBM's equipment line and have never had an issue. My only complaints are the lack of a docking device and the power connector, it is somewhat chintzy compared to the T and X lines.. Date published: 2016-09-28 Rated 5 out of 5 by Steven B from Simple, fast, focus! Working with this Ideapad for a month now. As with all new things, it's always getting used to it. For me f.e. the short Shift on the right :) Overall I am very satisfied, esp. with the SSD. Wondering why there is a 'sleep' mode on this piece. It is so fast. Perfect sound and display. Date published: 2016-09-05 Rated 5 out of 5 by JillP from Love it! I enjoy my Lenovo laptop enormously. It's a convenient size to use either on my lap or on a table. It's bright and very easy to see in all lights and had loads of features that I'm still discovering. I'm not crazy over Windows 10, but am adapting. It's very easy to setup and use. Date published: 2016-07-12 Rated 2 out of 5 by Rolskie from Not that impressive... I bought this laptop more than a month ago and I am disappointed because it's not that fast as I expect it to be with its Intel i7 quad core processor. Another thing is its keyboard which is too cramped. It would have been better if they took away the numbers keys.

Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 4 out of 5 by Bcosta86 from Fast and sleek machine This has been a great computer so far. Love the display. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Eternal Bullfrog from Does everything it promises, and more! Let me start by saying I bought this laptop to be, well, a laptop. I wanted a general high quality machine with decent performance levels to function as my primary home computer. And Lenovo delivered! The customization options available were not extensive for this particular model, but certainly more than enough for the average user. I went for the i7-6500 (dual core) CPU, integrated graphics(Intel HD 520), 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration. I'm no expert, so this review is from the perspective of a general user. Overall performance 5/5 Usage is mainly for Office programs, internet, games and a few specialized analysis programs like R and PRAAT Speed 5/5 Pretty good for all standard programs, and quite phenomenal for data-heavy PRAAT programs (at least when comparing to our older dual core Intel desktops) Graphics 4.5/5 Occasionally glitches while playing Skyrim but is doing incredibly well for general use, movies, streaming, lower configuration video games etc. Noise level 5/5 Can barely hear it at its loudest Portability 5/5 I may be behind the times here, but my previous laptop was monster compared to the 5 lb slimness that this machine is Maintenance 4/5 No hatch, and a non-removable battery. But I'm told this actually allows for larger power capacities, so I'm not complaining too much. Battery 5/5 At least so far (1month in) no issues and battery life is true to description at 4-5 hours with standard usage In short, good machine for the price, perfect for average use and even a little bit of data-heavy coding. Can't speak for support since I haven't needed it yet. So far, I love it!

Answered by: Limitchell Date published: 2016-08-28 Is the ram upgradable from 8gb to 16gb? Asked by: shab19863232 4GB of RAM is soldered to the systemboard. An 8GB stick can be added to the additional slot for a total of 12GB maximum. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-08-18 Am I able to use a docking station with this model? New to docking so am unsure if this is a standard feature or not. Thanks! Asked by: Dougedug No. This is a low end laptop and doesn't have that feature, but you really don't need it. I use a 4 port USB 3.0 hub that I connect an external mouse keyboard and whatever else I need to that and then just connect the hub to this. The Good: This is the cheapest brand name laptop I found that has a 1080p screen and has dual video outputs (VGA and HDMI, so I'm able to get a triple monitor setup with this). The system is also easily upgradeable with an SSD and more memory. The Bad: The keyboard and trackpad are horrendous. The up arrow key is next to the ?/ key and the right shift is to the right of the up arrow key! The designer/engineer who thought of this should have to use this type of keyboard for the rest of their lives as punishment (I will be afflicted with it for the next few years since I'm not buying another one for another 5 years and will watch out for this in the future!). I had to remap my keys in the OS and put masking tape over the keys! The two buttons on the touchpad can only be clicked at the very far right and left edges of the right and left buttons respectively. The middle and left/right areas of the right and left buttons respectively are not clickable. They also make a really loud clicking noise that sounds like a mouse from the 90's, you're pretty much stuck with using tap to click/drag on the touchpad. A DVD drive? Really? People are still stuck in the last decade I guess. Should have made the laptop thinner and lighter by not including that. The CPU fan is loud even when the system is idling and it's brand new, there's no dust in my air conditioned environment and the ambient temp is ~75F. I also dug into lm_sensors and the CPU fan speed is not controllable in this model, shame. Finally the screen is a gigantic 15.6", The 14" screen should be cheaper but it's more expensive. Economies of scale, no clue why the demand for 15.6" screens would be higher. Answered by: sabujp Date published: 2016-09-23 I would like some clarification on the Primary memory upgrade (RAM).

If that's something I would have looked at in more depth (that and the keyboard layout), I probably would not have purchased this laptop. Here are instructions for how to do it (see the picture at the very bottom): https://electro-medical.blogspot.com/2016/04/lenovo-ideapad-510-disassembling.html . Basically you have to take out all the screws from the bottom of the laptop, which then allows you to remove the cover holding the keyboard and you get to it from the top. This is really meant to be a throwaway laptop for most people.

Rated 5 out of 5 by mast127 from great feature @ a good price after a month of buying this, I'm really satisfied. it's worth the price, its better compare to the more expensive laptops of my friend. I really love this. Date published: 2016-07-31 Rated 3 out of 5 by Anil24 from Save for a Thinkpad A longtime Lenovo customer, I recently decided to replace my ancient Thinkpad with another Lenovo. This time, as a way to save a little money, I opted for the Ideapad 510-15SK [Intel i5-6100]. A more detailed review follows, but I wish that I had waited, and saved up for a Thinkpad. The Ideapads aren't much cheaper than the Thinkpads, and at the end of the day, Thinkpad quality trumps these average quality Ideapads. Pros: -INSTALL: There is little bloatware -DISPLAY: Nice sharp screen with vibrant colors -KEYBOARD: Keyboard is membrane, but feels good to type on -KEYBOARD COVER: The metal keyboard cover and frame around the screen feel sturdy Cons: (alas there are many) -DURABILITY: This is _my fault_ but I wrongly assumed that all Lenovo laptops came with the hard drive protection and spill-proof keyboards that the Thinkpads have. The Ideapads do not. This laptop does not have near the durability of the Thinkpad. -BUILD: The metal face on the keyboard and screen feel sturdy, but everything else seems flimsy. The external case (by this I mean the plastic back, or top of the laptop when the screen is closed) seems exceptionally flimsy. -SPEED: I expected a PC that was a bit more snappy. It's not terribly fast, and the Hard drive (5400RPM) seems really slow. -FAN: There seems to be a cooling fan that is ALWAYS on. It's not super-loud, but it's loud enough that it's slightly distracting and will take some getting used to. (This is personal preference, but my point of comparison is the super-silent old Thinkpad that I have.) -BATTERY: The battery cannot be removed from the PC!!!! I've never seen this before. This means that when/if it dies and needs to be replaced, I presume I'll be paying a pretty penny to have the PC serviced.This doesn't seem to be noted anywhere on the Product guide online -WEIGHT/GIRTH: The dimensions of the laptop are clearly listed. It's big and heavy. This is a system that really only works for the home user who occasionally might take the laptop to another room. It's not the type of machine that one can throw into a backpack and travel with. (Not only because of size/weight, but also perceived sturdiness.) Final comments: I paid less for an Ideapad and thought that I was getting more by going for an i5 processor than the nearest similarly priced Thinkpad, which has an i3. I've only realized after the fact, that the i3 and i5 (laptop processors) are almost exactly the same, except that the i5 overclocks and runs a bit faster when more speed is needed. This makes little difference to most users. If I could return this, I would. But I've already installed software on it, and I presume that Lenovo would not take the return (and then there's a 15% restocking fee). Date published: 2016-06-29 Rated 4 out of 5 by Bijit from Comes with good features I bought this on this July & I'm pretty much happy, but the only thing which I didn't like about this machine is that it doesn't have Type C port. Date published: 2016-09-09 Rated 3 out of 5 by fsha from getting used to it I've had this laptop for about a month and it's taking some getting used to. The half sized shift key is a real problem-- I'm going to have to reprogram the pgup to shift if I'm ever going to be productive. The battery life is not as good as I was expecting it to be, and the program that tells you how much you have left isn't linear...the last three hours vanish in about 30 minutes. (I'm using Ubuntu linux...so that may be the problem). The wireless, billed as especially good, does not pick up a signal as well as my old lenovo thinkpad did. Otherwise, adequate. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by leftfieldhero from Solid offering, decent features for the price. What's great: Backlight keyboard, Screen looks nice, my model had 12 GB DDR4 which was plenty. I also had a 1 TB 5400 RPM hard drive which gave plenty of space, speakers were fair for a laptop. The trackpad was big and responsive. Nice weight for the size. What I'd like better: The backlight for the keyboard has two options. On or off. The trackpad would have been nice to have the buttons as a part of the pad. Theres just a little too much flex everywhere, the screen and base for my liking but i suppose this is a trade off for the nice weight. In the end: I was hoping this would suit my needs but I think it's just a little too big and I'm afraid a little to fragile for life with me an I'll be returning it but I'm not sad or disappointed I tried it and really it's no fault of the machine's just my preference. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Nath98 from Great features! Bought this 3 months ago, works extremely fast. Bios lasts about 3 seconds, highly recommend, very fast and light weight laptop. Decent but battery life as well, looks very modern though, interface is kinda sloppy and very wide, gamers will have trouble since keys are spread out making it harder to click, but overall laptops ace, 10/10 Date published: 2016-10-14 Rated 3 out of 5 by engdahl from Nonstandard keyboard layout Great specs for a great price, however, if you touch-type I would suggest a Thinkpad with a standard keyboard layout instead. After a couple days getting used to the Ideapad we realized that the reason we were making so many typing errors is that the right shift key has moved to the right. The up-arrow is where you would expect the shift key to be. This is a huge design flaw, and defeats touch-typists. One other possible problem is the sharp edge at the front where your wrist will rest. This should have been rounded and smooth. Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by disappointed in nj from Disappointed First, I paid an extra $20 for expedited delivery. Got it 15 days after I ordered, and they didn't include the full shipping address so I had to pick the thing up from UPS. I agree with other reviewers that the laptop feels and is a bit flimsy, the shift key on the right side isn't in the standard position (why would they do that?), I've been on the laptop for less than hour and it's hot to the touch, and the speed seems very slow. Don't buy this machine. Date published: 2016-07-20 Rated 3 out of 5 by kenbh from Nice Laptop! I bought this a month ago to replace a machine destroyed by lightening. It is relatively fast computer with good features. The screen is wonderfully bright and clear with full-HD resolution. With only 3 USB ports I have purchased a separate hub to handle peripherals. The keyboard has a good feel to it, and the separate number pad was a selling point, but I am making more mistakes in typing with this keyboard so key placement must be a little different from my previous machine. The audio system and Dolby application work well when using the computer speakers but the quality is awful when connected to an outside system. The computer is light-weight with a slim profile. Overall this is a solid computer for the price, but a few minor modifications would make it exceptional. Date published: 2016-08-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by hrxnowak from Laptop is fantastic/charger cord sucks The laptop itself is great. Fast and fun additives like the light up keyboard. Fast start up, and bright screen. My one and only problem is the horrific charger cord. Its a fat box on the end where it plugs in, followed by short cord to computer itself. Problem lies in any movement of cord. Due to the heavy base where it plugs in, it constantly falls out of the plug in. Needs to be fixed. Oh and the mouse click button takes a long time to get used to. Not easy to scroll and click. Date published: 2016-10-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Kathy67 from New laptop Love it! Works like a charm. Great replacement for my very old computer. Date published: 2016-07-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by nycbauer from Works Great I have been using this for a few weeks, and I have been very happy with the performance. It starts up quickly, runs fast, and the battery life is very good (I've only once had to run to plug it in when I forgot to charge it the night before after using it throughout the day). The screen is fantastic, the resolution is great, and very clear. I have only two pet peeves with it. 1) the keyboard layout is a little weird. Since it's a full keyboard (a big plus for that) they had to stick the right shift button among the directional keys, so I frequently end up hitting the up key instead of the shift. the second is that when I've attached external monitors to it, the text is a little fuzzy. It could be a setting I'm missing, but I've tried different monitors on the different ports with different settings. Date published: 2016-10-09 Rated 1 out of 5 by ViolinJ from Keyboard doesn't work, but cannot return it. The key "J" on the Keyboard doesn't work, but cannot return it. How can I exchange a new one? Date published: 2016-06-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by alwayswright145 from Great little machine! I use this for business and pleasure, accounting and writing, FB and e-mail. I love the wide screen and the accounting pad. I love the Windows 10 operating system and the notifications tab. The only thing I'd change on this is the location of the right hand shift button and the Page Up button. I'd reverse them, as they are constantly messing up my typing. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Lear from Great features and performance I was looking for a laptop that was fast and had many features. I was not disappointed with the IdeaPad 510. Clicking and starting anything opens almost instantaneously. I am able to get so much more done in my day and I am not frustrated waiting and waiting. It is light weight and easy to take where ever I need to go. I don't go anywhere without it. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by CustomerUA from Lenovo 510 15ISK 80SR00DJRA review I bought this a month ago... specially choose the model with minimum characteristics (4Gb\500Gb\No ODD) to define in work process what components should I upgrade and what should I leave intact. I've played some games with 4Gb onboard memory and have no problems with games like [World of Tanks\World of Warships] but [The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt] save game load time was about 5-8 minutes depends of scene details. Personal chest worked extremly slow (12 sec for moving 1 thing). So I've decided to upgrade system memory. In official datasheets there is a limit for 12 Gb maximum memory, but I decided to have a risk and install 16 Gb memory module which is extremly cheap in my region (TED416G2400C16-S01). It's working nice and finally my 510 has 20Gb of memory. [Witcher 3] save game load became much shorter - less then 60 sec., but personal chest are still slow-working. As for the graphics memory - that is slow DDR-3 standard, but there is no need to use quick one because of memory bandwidth is 64 bit. As for support in my region - there are no direct contacts to support team (that is bad), just the society forum of owners, but in other side - you can find info on every spare part used in manufacturing whith detailed photos of them (in official site - partslookup) - that is great. *Advantages* 1. 16 Gb memory modules could be installed. 2. IPS screen. 3. A lot of actual technologies (aug 2016). 4. Additional S(H)DD could be installed in yhe slot of ODD. 5. Could install\change memory\hdd\battery in 60 sec. without loosing warranty (removable covers). 6. Full-size keyboard with numpad and lithings. 7. Good price\quality rating (another manufacturers could not suggest any model with IPS screen for that price in my region). *Disadvanteges* 1. The only memory slot and 1 module is onboard, so different sized modules are working in one-channel mode 2. If you need an OS another then Win 10 you should have some experience in solvig such promlems (preformatting disk with another utility, copiyng 510 drivers to that disk part, then installing OS, pre-implementing USB 3 drivers in distributive, and than using drivers from that specially created disk partition). 3. Extremly loud signal when plugging to charger (I coul not found how to turn off this *pity feature*) is inconvinient at night time. 4. For BIOS menu entering or loading from external drive you shold use paper clip (the hole at left side of laptop). 5. Full HD for the 15.6" screen size could be difficult to manage in some programs (especially when you are connecting to another PC via RDP) 6. Keyboard [Right Shift] and [Up Arrow] have inconvinient interposition. 7. Laptop W-dimention have the maximum size for 15.6" devices and you could have some troubles whith your previous bag for the device of such form-factor. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Tomcat10 from Great value I purchased model 80SR001FUS. It has all the features I wanted at a very reasonable price. I have used Lenovo products since their purchase of IBM's equipment line and have never had an issue. My only complaints are the lack of a docking device and the power connector, it is somewhat chintzy compared to the T and X lines.. Date published: 2016-09-28 Rated 5 out of 5 by Steven B from Simple, fast, focus! Working with this Ideapad for a month now. As with all new things, it's always getting used to it. For me f.e. the short Shift on the right :) Overall I am very satisfied, esp. with the SSD. Wondering why there is a 'sleep' mode on this piece. It is so fast. Perfect sound and display. Date published: 2016-09-05 Rated 5 out of 5 by JillP from Love it! I enjoy my Lenovo laptop enormously. It's a convenient size to use either on my lap or on a table. It's bright and very easy to see in all lights and had loads of features that I'm still discovering. I'm not crazy over Windows 10, but am adapting. It's very easy to setup and use. Date published: 2016-07-12 Rated 2 out of 5 by Rolskie from Not that impressive... I bought this laptop more than a month ago and I am disappointed because it's not that fast as I expect it to be with its Intel i7 quad core processor. Another thing is its keyboard which is too cramped. It would have been better if they took away the numbers keys. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Yorch1979 from Great Laptop i bought this machine a month ago.im happy with it. so far so good. it delivers the goods it advertises. haven't tested the full i7 processor yet, but im sure there will be no issues. Date published: 2016-08-05 Rated 1 out of 5 by Muser from 510 Lenovo laptop I has so much trouble getting the unit to attach to the internet I sent it back. It simply would not recognize my connection and nothing support could do would correct the issue. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by CameronH97 from Great Laptop!! I bought this a device a month ago and it is great!! I needed the powerful processor and graphics card for school and it works fantastic! Great purchase and a great price Date published: 2016-09-14 Rated 5 out of 5 by Office Works from Brilliant Bought two Yoga's 510, one for myself, one for my son. We both are happy with this product. Date published: 2016-10-06 Rated 4 out of 5 by Farshad_Lenovo_ideapad510 from Great Laptop I bought it last month. It works well. Please update its touch pad driver as soon as you buy it. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 5 out of 5 by Coach Level 2 from Has great features I brought this laptop about a month ago and really enjoy it. Date published: 2016-07-31 Rated 5 out of 5 by shab19863232 from Great Laptop for a Reasonable price I wanted to know is the ram upgradable? from 8gb to 16gb? Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 4 out of 5 by Bcosta86 from Fast and sleek machine This has been a great computer so far. Love the display. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Eternal Bullfrog from Does everything it promises, and more! Let me start by saying I bought this laptop to be, well, a laptop. I wanted a general high quality machine with decent performance levels to function as my primary home computer. And Lenovo delivered! The customization options available were not extensive for this particular model, but certainly more than enough for the average user. I went for the i7-6500 (dual core) CPU, integrated graphics(Intel HD 520), 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration. I'm no expert, so this review is from the perspective of a general user. Overall performance 5/5 Usage is mainly for Office programs, internet, games and a few specialized analysis programs like R and PRAAT Speed 5/5 Pretty good for all standard programs, and quite phenomenal for data-heavy PRAAT programs (at least when comparing to our older dual core Intel desktops) Graphics 4.5/5 Occasionally glitches while playing Skyrim but is doing incredibly well for general use, movies, streaming, lower configuration video games etc. Noise level 5/5 Can barely hear it at its loudest Portability 5/5 I may be behind the times here, but my previous laptop was monster compared to the 5 lb slimness that this machine is Maintenance 4/5 No hatch, and a non-removable battery. But I'm told this actually allows for larger power capacities, so I'm not complaining too much. Battery 5/5 At least so far (1month in) no issues and battery life is true to description at 4-5 hours with standard usage In short, good machine for the price, perfect for average use and even a little bit of data-heavy coding. Can't speak for support since I haven't needed it yet. So far, I love it!

Oh and the mouse click button takes a long time to get used to. Not easy to scroll and click. Date published: 2016-10-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Kathy67 from New laptop Love it! Works like a charm. Great replacement for my very old computer. Date published: 2016-07-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by nycbauer from Works Great I have been using this for a few weeks, and I have been very happy with the performance. It starts up quickly, runs fast, and the battery life is very good (I've only once had to run to plug it in when I forgot to charge it the night before after using it throughout the day). The screen is fantastic, the resolution is great, and very clear. I have only two pet peeves with it. 1) the keyboard layout is a little weird. Since it's a full keyboard (a big plus for that) they had to stick the right shift button among the directional keys, so I frequently end up hitting the up key instead of the shift. the second is that when I've attached external monitors to it, the text is a little fuzzy. It could be a setting I'm missing, but I've tried different monitors on the different ports with different settings.

I love the wide screen and the accounting pad. I love the Windows 10 operating system and the notifications tab. The only thing I'd change on this is the location of the right hand shift button and the Page Up button. I'd reverse them, as they are constantly messing up my typing. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Lear from Great features and performance I was looking for a laptop that was fast and had many features. I was not disappointed with the IdeaPad 510. Clicking and starting anything opens almost instantaneously. I am able to get so much more done in my day and I am not frustrated waiting and waiting. It is light weight and easy to take where ever I need to go. I don't go anywhere without it. Date published: 2016-08-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by CustomerUA from Lenovo 510 15ISK 80SR00DJRA review I bought this a month ago... specially choose the model with minimum characteristics (4Gb\500Gb\No ODD) to define in work process what components should I upgrade and what should I leave intact. I've played some games with 4Gb onboard memory and have no problems with games like [World of Tanks\World of Warships] but [The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt] save game load time was about 5-8 minutes depends of scene details. Personal chest worked extremly slow (12 sec for moving 1 thing). So I've decided to upgrade system memory. In official datasheets there is a limit for 12 Gb maximum memory, but I decided to have a risk and install 16 Gb memory module which is extremly cheap in my region (TED416G2400C16-S01). It's working nice and finally my 510 has 20Gb of memory. [Witcher 3] save game load became much shorter - less then 60 sec., but personal chest are still slow-working. As for the graphics memory - that is slow DDR-3 standard, but there is no need to use quick one because of memory bandwidth is 64 bit. As for support in my region - there are no direct contacts to support team (that is bad), just the society forum of owners, but in other side - you can find info on every spare part used in manufacturing whith detailed photos of them (in official site - partslookup) - that is great. *Advantages* 1. 16 Gb memory modules could be installed. 2. IPS screen. 3. A lot of actual technologies (aug 2016). 4. Additional S(H)DD could be installed in yhe slot of ODD. 5. Could install\change memory\hdd\battery in 60 sec. without loosing warranty (removable covers). 6. Full-size keyboard with numpad and lithings. 7. Good price\quality rating (another manufacturers could not suggest any model with IPS screen for that price in my region). *Disadvanteges* 1. The only memory slot and 1 module is onboard, so different sized modules are working in one-channel mode 2. If you need an OS another then Win 10 you should have some experience in solvig such promlems (preformatting disk with another utility, copiyng 510 drivers to that disk part, then installing OS, pre-implementing USB 3 drivers in distributive, and than using drivers from that specially created disk partition). 3. Extremly loud signal when plugging to charger (I coul not found how to turn off this *pity feature*) is inconvinient at night time. 4. For BIOS menu entering or loading from external drive you shold use paper clip (the hole at left side of laptop). 5. Full HD for the 15.6" screen size could be difficult to manage in some programs (especially when you are connecting to another PC via RDP) 6. Keyboard [Right Shift] and [Up Arrow] have inconvinient interposition. 7. Laptop W-dimention have the maximum size for 15.6" devices and you could have some troubles whith your previous bag for the device of such form-factor.

I have used Lenovo products since their purchase of IBM's equipment line and have never had an issue.

Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Eternal Bullfrog from Does everything it promises, and more! Let me start by saying I bought this laptop to be, well, a laptop. I wanted a general high quality machine with decent performance levels to function as my primary home computer. And Lenovo delivered! The customization options available were not extensive for this particular model, but certainly more than enough for the average user. I went for the i7-6500 (dual core) CPU, integrated graphics(Intel HD 520), 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration. I'm no expert, so this review is from the perspective of a general user. Overall performance 5/5 Usage is mainly for Office programs, internet, games and a few specialized analysis programs like R and PRAAT Speed 5/5 Pretty good for all standard programs, and quite phenomenal for data-heavy PRAAT programs (at least when comparing to our older dual core Intel desktops) Graphics 4.5/5 Occasionally glitches while playing Skyrim but is doing incredibly well for general use, movies, streaming, lower configuration video games etc. Noise level 5/5 Can barely hear it at its loudest Portability 5/5 I may be behind the times here, but my previous laptop was monster compared to the 5 lb slimness that this machine is Maintenance 4/5 No hatch, and a non-removable battery. But I'm told this actually allows for larger power capacities, so I'm not complaining too much. Battery 5/5 At least so far (1month in) no issues and battery life is true to description at 4-5 hours with standard usage In short, good machine for the price, perfect for average use and even a little bit of data-heavy coding. Can't speak for support since I haven't needed it yet. So far, I love it! Date published: 2016-08-22

Rated 3 out of 5 by Anil24 from Save for a Thinkpad A longtime Lenovo customer, I recently decided to replace my ancient Thinkpad with another Lenovo. This time, as a way to save a little money, I opted for the Ideapad 510-15SK [Intel i5-6100]. A more detailed review follows, but I wish that I had waited, and saved up for a Thinkpad. The Ideapads aren't much cheaper than the Thinkpads, and at the end of the day, Thinkpad quality trumps these average quality Ideapads. Pros: -INSTALL: There is little bloatware -DISPLAY: Nice sharp screen with vibrant colors -KEYBOARD: Keyboard is membrane, but feels good to type on -KEYBOARD COVER: The metal keyboard cover and frame around the screen feel sturdy Cons: (alas there are many) -DURABILITY: This is _my fault_ but I wrongly assumed that all Lenovo laptops came with the hard drive protection and spill-proof keyboards that the Thinkpads have. The Ideapads do not. This laptop does not have near the durability of the Thinkpad. -BUILD: The metal face on the keyboard and screen feel sturdy, but everything else seems flimsy. The external case (by this I mean the plastic back, or top of the laptop when the screen is closed) seems exceptionally flimsy. -SPEED: I expected a PC that was a bit more snappy. It's not terribly fast, and the Hard drive (5400RPM) seems really slow. -FAN: There seems to be a cooling fan that is ALWAYS on. It's not super-loud, but it's loud enough that it's slightly distracting and will take some getting used to. (This is personal preference, but my point of comparison is the super-silent old Thinkpad that I have.) -BATTERY: The battery cannot be removed from the PC!!!! I've never seen this before. This means that when/if it dies and needs to be replaced, I presume I'll be paying a pretty penny to have the PC serviced.This doesn't seem to be noted anywhere on the Product guide online -WEIGHT/GIRTH: The dimensions of the laptop are clearly listed. It's big and heavy. This is a system that really only works for the home user who occasionally might take the laptop to another room. It's not the type of machine that one can throw into a backpack and travel with. (Not only because of size/weight, but also perceived sturdiness.) Final comments: I paid less for an Ideapad and thought that I was getting more by going for an i5 processor than the nearest similarly priced Thinkpad, which has an i3. I've only realized after the fact, that the i3 and i5 (laptop processors) are almost exactly the same, except that the i5 overclocks and runs a bit faster when more speed is needed. This makes little difference to most users. If I could return this, I would. But I've already installed software on it, and I presume that Lenovo would not take the return (and then there's a 15% restocking fee). Date published: 2016-06-29

Rated 3 out of 5 by fsha from getting used to it I've had this laptop for about a month and it's taking some getting used to. The half sized shift key is a real problem-- I'm going to have to reprogram the pgup to shift if I'm ever going to be productive. The battery life is not as good as I was expecting it to be, and the program that tells you how much you have left isn't linear...the last three hours vanish in about 30 minutes. (I'm using Ubuntu linux...so that may be the problem). The wireless, billed as especially good, does not pick up a signal as well as my old lenovo thinkpad did. Otherwise, adequate.

Rated 4 out of 5 by leftfieldhero from Solid offering, decent features for the price. What's great: Backlight keyboard, Screen looks nice, my model had 12 GB DDR4 which was plenty. I also had a 1 TB 5400 RPM hard drive which gave plenty of space, speakers were fair for a laptop. The trackpad was big and responsive. Nice weight for the size. What I'd like better: The backlight for the keyboard has two options. On or off. The trackpad would have been nice to have the buttons as a part of the pad. Theres just a little too much flex everywhere, the screen and base for my liking but i suppose this is a trade off for the nice weight. In the end: I was hoping this would suit my needs but I think it's just a little too big and I'm afraid a little to fragile for life with me an I'll be returning it but I'm not sad or disappointed I tried it and really it's no fault of the machine's just my preference.

Rated 3 out of 5 by engdahl from Nonstandard keyboard layout Great specs for a great price, however, if you touch-type I would suggest a Thinkpad with a standard keyboard layout instead. After a couple days getting used to the Ideapad we realized that the reason we were making so many typing errors is that the right shift key has moved to the right. The up-arrow is where you would expect the shift key to be. This is a huge design flaw, and defeats touch-typists. One other possible problem is the sharp edge at the front where your wrist will rest. This should have been rounded and smooth. Date published: 2016-07-24

The screen is wonderfully bright and clear with full-HD resolution. With only 3 USB ports I have purchased a separate hub to handle peripherals. The keyboard has a good feel to it, and the separate number pad was a selling point, but I am making more mistakes in typing with this keyboard so key placement must be a little different from my previous machine. The audio system and Dolby application work well when using the computer speakers but the quality is awful when connected to an outside system. The computer is light-weight with a slim profile. Overall this is a solid computer for the price, but a few minor modifications would make it exceptional. Date published: 2016-08-02

It starts up quickly, runs fast, and the battery life is very good (I've only once had to run to plug it in when I forgot to charge it the night before after using it throughout the day). The screen is fantastic, the resolution is great, and very clear. I have only two pet peeves with it. 1) the keyboard layout is a little weird. Since it's a full keyboard (a big plus for that) they had to stick the right shift button among the directional keys, so I frequently end up hitting the up key instead of the shift. the second is that when I've attached external monitors to it, the text is a little fuzzy. It could be a setting I'm missing, but I've tried different monitors on the different ports with different settings. Date published: 2016-10-09

Rated 5 out of 5 by CustomerUA from Lenovo 510 15ISK 80SR00DJRA review I bought this a month ago... specially choose the model with minimum characteristics (4Gb\500Gb\No ODD) to define in work process what components should I upgrade and what should I leave intact. I've played some games with 4Gb onboard memory and have no problems with games like [World of Tanks\World of Warships] but [The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt] save game load time was about 5-8 minutes depends of scene details. Personal chest worked extremly slow (12 sec for moving 1 thing). So I've decided to upgrade system memory. In official datasheets there is a limit for 12 Gb maximum memory, but I decided to have a risk and install 16 Gb memory module which is extremly cheap in my region (TED416G2400C16-S01). It's working nice and finally my 510 has 20Gb of memory. [Witcher 3] save game load became much shorter - less then 60 sec., but personal chest are still slow-working. As for the graphics memory - that is slow DDR-3 standard, but there is no need to use quick one because of memory bandwidth is 64 bit. As for support in my region - there are no direct contacts to support team (that is bad), just the society forum of owners, but in other side - you can find info on every spare part used in manufacturing whith detailed photos of them (in official site - partslookup) - that is great. *Advantages* 1. 16 Gb memory modules could be installed. 2. IPS screen. 3. A lot of actual technologies (aug 2016). 4. Additional S(H)DD could be installed in yhe slot of ODD. 5. Could install\change memory\hdd\battery in 60 sec. without loosing warranty (removable covers). 6. Full-size keyboard with numpad and lithings. 7. Good price\quality rating (another manufacturers could not suggest any model with IPS screen for that price in my region). *Disadvanteges* 1. The only memory slot and 1 module is onboard, so different sized modules are working in one-channel mode 2. If you need an OS another then Win 10 you should have some experience in solvig such promlems (preformatting disk with another utility, copiyng 510 drivers to that disk part, then installing OS, pre-implementing USB 3 drivers in distributive, and than using drivers from that specially created disk partition). 3. Extremly loud signal when plugging to charger (I coul not found how to turn off this *pity feature*) is inconvinient at night time. 4. For BIOS menu entering or loading from external drive you shold use paper clip (the hole at left side of laptop). 5. Full HD for the 15.6" screen size could be difficult to manage in some programs (especially when you are connecting to another PC via RDP) 6. Keyboard [Right Shift] and [Up Arrow] have inconvinient interposition. 7. Laptop W-dimention have the maximum size for 15.6" devices and you could have some troubles whith your previous bag for the device of such form-factor. Date published: 2016-08-26

Rated 4 out of 5 by Tomcat10 from Great value I purchased model 80SR001FUS. It has all the features I wanted at a very reasonable price. I have used Lenovo products since their purchase of IBM's equipment line and have never had an issue. My only complaints are the lack of a docking device and the power connector, it is somewhat chintzy compared to the T and X lines.. Date published: 2016-09-28

Rated 5 out of 5 by Steven B from Simple, fast, focus! Working with this Ideapad for a month now. As with all new things, it's always getting used to it. For me f.e. the short Shift on the right :) Overall I am very satisfied, esp. with the SSD. Wondering why there is a 'sleep' mode on this piece. It is so fast. Perfect sound and display.

It's bright and very easy to see in all lights and had loads of features that I'm still discovering. I'm not crazy over Windows 10, but am adapting. It's very easy to setup and use.

Rated 2 out of 5 by Rolskie from Not that impressive... I bought this laptop more than a month ago and I am disappointed because it's not that fast as I expect it to be with its Intel i7 quad core processor. Another thing is its keyboard which is too cramped. It would have been better if they took away the numbers keys. Date published: 2016-09-01

Rated 5 out of 5 by Eternal Bullfrog from Does everything it promises, and more! Let me start by saying I bought this laptop to be, well, a laptop. I wanted a general high quality machine with decent performance levels to function as my primary home computer. And Lenovo delivered! The customization options available were not extensive for this particular model, but certainly more than enough for the average user. I went for the i7-6500 (dual core) CPU, integrated graphics(Intel HD 520), 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration. I'm no expert, so this review is from the perspective of a general user. Overall performance 5/5 Usage is mainly for Office programs, internet, games and a few specialized analysis programs like R and PRAAT Speed 5/5 Pretty good for all standard programs, and quite phenomenal for data-heavy PRAAT programs (at least when comparing to our older dual core Intel desktops) Graphics 4.5/5 Occasionally glitches while playing Skyrim but is doing incredibly well for general use, movies, streaming, lower configuration video games etc. Noise level 5/5 Can barely hear it at its loudest Portability 5/5 I may be behind the times here, but my previous laptop was monster compared to the 5 lb slimness that this machine is Maintenance 4/5 No hatch, and a non-removable battery. But I'm told this actually allows for larger power capacities, so I'm not complaining too much. Battery 5/5 At least so far (1month in) no issues and battery life is true to description at 4-5 hours with standard usage In short, good machine for the price, perfect for average use and even a little bit of data-heavy coding. Can't speak for support since I haven't needed it yet. So far, I love it! Date published: 2016-08-22

Does this computer have an HDMI port? Asked by: Arlene1 yes Answered by: lovedarl Date published: 2016-09-02 Does this computer come with McAfee or a McAfee trial pre-installed? Asked by: gunungapi Yes it does come with a free year's subscription. We Uninstaller it in favor of another Antivirus program though. Answered by: Limitchell Date published: 2016-08-28 Is the ram upgradable from 8gb to 16gb? Asked by: shab19863232 4GB of RAM is soldered to the systemboard. An 8GB stick can be added to the additional slot for a total of 12GB maximum. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-08-18 Am I able to use a docking station with this model? New to docking so am unsure if this is a standard feature or not. Thanks! Asked by: Dougedug No. This is a low end laptop and doesn't have that feature, but you really don't need it. I use a 4 port USB 3.0 hub that I connect an external mouse keyboard and whatever else I need to that and then just connect the hub to this. The Good: This is the cheapest brand name laptop I found that has a 1080p screen and has dual video outputs (VGA and HDMI, so I'm able to get a triple monitor setup with this). The system is also easily upgradeable with an SSD and more memory. The Bad: The keyboard and trackpad are horrendous. The up arrow key is next to the ?/ key and the right shift is to the right of the up arrow key! The designer/engineer who thought of this should have to use this type of keyboard for the rest of their lives as punishment (I will be afflicted with it for the next few years since I'm not buying another one for another 5 years and will watch out for this in the future!). I had to remap my keys in the OS and put masking tape over the keys! The two buttons on the touchpad can only be clicked at the very far right and left edges of the right and left buttons respectively. The middle and left/right areas of the right and left buttons respectively are not clickable. They also make a really loud clicking noise that sounds like a mouse from the 90's, you're pretty much stuck with using tap to click/drag on the touchpad. A DVD drive? Really? People are still stuck in the last decade I guess. Should have made the laptop thinner and lighter by not including that. The CPU fan is loud even when the system is idling and it's brand new, there's no dust in my air conditioned environment and the ambient temp is ~75F. I also dug into lm_sensors and the CPU fan speed is not controllable in this model, shame. Finally the screen is a gigantic 15.6", The 14" screen should be cheaper but it's more expensive. Economies of scale, no clue why the demand for 15.6" screens would be higher. Answered by: sabujp Date published: 2016-09-23 I would like some clarification on the Primary memory upgrade (RAM). This model comes in 8 and 4GB of Ram. The question was answered. Stating the RAM is soldered into the board. There is clearly an access panel for HDD and RAM access.Can you upgrade RAM? Asked by: GeekSquadMike is there room for a second HDD that is not an SSD? Answered by: Medusanyc Date published: 2016-06-29 Is the RAM user upgrade-able? Asked by: JoseD Yes just talked to support. They showed me a .pdf manual. up gradable to 12GB of RAM. plus if you look at the pic's there is an access panel. Answered by: GeekSquadMike Date published: 2016-10-14 For the idea pad 510 for 649.99, is there a SSD option? Or do they only come with HDD? Asked by: Jayyyyyyyy Hello the option for the 510 that is comes with HDD cannot be upgraded to SSD but we do have a model that has a SSD please take a look with this part number 80SR001FUS thank you for your inquiry have a great day.

Asked by: kasturi Model 80SR002TUS comes with NVIDIA GeForce 940MX (4GB memory), the battery is integrated in this product, yes this comes with Windows 10 Home 64 Bit preinstalled, no we cannot ship internationally, and Camera 1.0MP (HD720P), fixed focus Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-10-03 the $649 model is the ram upgradable to 16 gb? Asked by: kasturi 12GB max Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-10-03 how do i replace the battery? Asked by: edu_casal You don't easily. If that's something I would have looked at in more depth (that and the keyboard layout), I probably would not have purchased this laptop. Here are instructions for how to do it (see the picture at the very bottom): https://electro-medical.blogspot.com/2016/04/lenovo-ideapad-510-disassembling.html . Basically you have to take out all the screws from the bottom of the laptop, which then allows you to remove the cover holding the keyboard and you get to it from the top. This is really meant to be a throwaway laptop for most people. Answered by: sabujp Date published: 2016-09-22 laptop charger is not provided with the 499$ model? why the Lenovo 45W AC Wall Adapter(UL) showing up in the accessory list ? Asked by: Pannu Hello All our machines come with Power supply AC Adapter thank you have a great day Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-15 How do I access the BIOS on this device?

Asked by: Bobjim Hello this Ideapad 510 has DVD Optical drive no need to purchase external thank you have a great day Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-09 can you buy it with a spanish keyboard? Asked by: aaarrrr Hello no it only comes with English keyboard thank you have a great day Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-06 The HDD are easily replaceable and you can upgrade the RAM with an extra slot, that is much appreciated...But can the battery be replaced? What do I do if the battery die in a few years, or if I need to completely drain the energy of the computer? Asked by: P RodrÃ­guez Hello the battery is integrated if battery fails you will have to contact Lenovo for further instructions thank you have a great day Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-06 Hello!

New to docking so am unsure if this is a standard feature or not. Thanks! Asked by: Dougedug No. This is a low end laptop and doesn't have that feature, but you really don't need it. I use a 4 port USB 3.0 hub that I connect an external mouse keyboard and whatever else I need to that and then just connect the hub to this. The Good: This is the cheapest brand name laptop I found that has a 1080p screen and has dual video outputs (VGA and HDMI, so I'm able to get a triple monitor setup with this). The system is also easily upgradeable with an SSD and more memory. The Bad: The keyboard and trackpad are horrendous. The up arrow key is next to the ?/ key and the right shift is to the right of the up arrow key! The designer/engineer who thought of this should have to use this type of keyboard for the rest of their lives as punishment (I will be afflicted with it for the next few years since I'm not buying another one for another 5 years and will watch out for this in the future!). I had to remap my keys in the OS and put masking tape over the keys! The two buttons on the touchpad can only be clicked at the very far right and left edges of the right and left buttons respectively. The middle and left/right areas of the right and left buttons respectively are not clickable. They also make a really loud clicking noise that sounds like a mouse from the 90's, you're pretty much stuck with using tap to click/drag on the touchpad. A DVD drive? Really? People are still stuck in the last decade I guess. Should have made the laptop thinner and lighter by not including that. The CPU fan is loud even when the system is idling and it's brand new, there's no dust in my air conditioned environment and the ambient temp is ~75F. I also dug into lm_sensors and the CPU fan speed is not controllable in this model, shame. Finally the screen is a gigantic 15.6", The 14" screen should be cheaper but it's more expensive. Economies of scale, no clue why the demand for 15.6" screens would be higher. Answered by: sabujp Date published: 2016-09-23 I would like some clarification on the Primary memory upgrade (RAM).

Am I able to use a docking station with this model? New to docking so am unsure if this is a standard feature or not. Thanks! Asked by: Dougedug No. This is a low end laptop and doesn't have that feature, but you really don't need it. I use a 4 port USB 3.0 hub that I connect an external mouse keyboard and whatever else I need to that and then just connect the hub to this. The Good: This is the cheapest brand name laptop I found that has a 1080p screen and has dual video outputs (VGA and HDMI, so I'm able to get a triple monitor setup with this). The system is also easily upgradeable with an SSD and more memory. The Bad: The keyboard and trackpad are horrendous. The up arrow key is next to the ?/ key and the right shift is to the right of the up arrow key! The designer/engineer who thought of this should have to use this type of keyboard for the rest of their lives as punishment (I will be afflicted with it for the next few years since I'm not buying another one for another 5 years and will watch out for this in the future!). I had to remap my keys in the OS and put masking tape over the keys! The two buttons on the touchpad can only be clicked at the very far right and left edges of the right and left buttons respectively. The middle and left/right areas of the right and left buttons respectively are not clickable. They also make a really loud clicking noise that sounds like a mouse from the 90's, you're pretty much stuck with using tap to click/drag on the touchpad. A DVD drive? Really? People are still stuck in the last decade I guess. Should have made the laptop thinner and lighter by not including that. The CPU fan is loud even when the system is idling and it's brand new, there's no dust in my air conditioned environment and the ambient temp is ~75F. I also dug into lm_sensors and the CPU fan speed is not controllable in this model, shame. Finally the screen is a gigantic 15.6", The 14" screen should be cheaper but it's more expensive.
