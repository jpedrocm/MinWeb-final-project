This is the first laptop that I've seen that runs cool. It doesn't have an easily removable back to upgrade the memory which the factory says it can go from the installed 4GB up to 8GB. A Hard Drive light would be nice. Graphics are okay. It works fine for what I expected.

This is the first laptop that I've seen that runs cool. It doesn't have an easily removable back to upgrade the memory which the factory says it can go from the installed 4GB up to 8GB. A Hard Drive light would be nice. Graphics are okay. It works fine for what I expected.
