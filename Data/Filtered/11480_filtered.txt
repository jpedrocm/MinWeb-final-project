Smart Cache With Intel Smart Cache you benefit from increased data access because the cache is shared between the cores from a single access point and optimized by workload demand. That means your system is making maximum use of its resources, enhancing multi-threading, and reducing storage redundancy. 1TB Hard Drive A terabyte equals one trillion bytes. To put that in perspective, that's room enough for about 250,000 MP3 files, or according to Ron White, in his book, "How Computers Work", 20,000 four-drawer filing cabinets filled with text. In addition, this hard drive operates at a variable RPM which means you've got the best of both worlds, full speed for demanding loads and energy conservation during minimal access. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M Gaming on a portable device is all about performance that gives you more power efficiency. Thanks to Battery Boost and Optimus, the GeForce GTX 960M lets you play longer when you're unplugged. Add to that support for DirectX 12 and you'll be armed for victory in every battle.

Automatically activated to increase processor performance to its highest state, Turbo Boost 2.0 enables the processor frequency to dynamically increase, based on demand, until maximum frequency is reached depending on the number of active cores. In addition, Turbo Boost 2.0 uses several algorithms working together to power, current, and temperature to ensure energy efficiency. For short periods of time, Turbo Boost 2.0 can even enable the processor to run at a higher power level than its rated upper power limit. Intel Hyper-Threading Technology Intel's hyper-threading technology means you'll get peak performance for your multithreaded applications thanks to higher processing throughput. To put it simply, each core of the processor is capable of working on multiple tasks at the same time. Intel Virtualization Technology Consolidates multiple environments into a single server or PC. It provides greater user flexibility that can help reduce costs, improve security, and increase resiliency regarding contingency planning.

Intel Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology Now get even more performance enhancing, energy conserving benefits from Intel. With SpeedStep technology, your processor simultaneously switches voltage and frequency to high or low levels depending on processor load. Enhanced SpeedStep technology performs voltage and frequency changes separately so the system performs better with reduced latency due to system unavailability. Thermal Monitoring Technologies This feature is designed to protect the processor in the event of unusual circumstances such as cooling fan failure which can cause damage if internal chassis temperatures become higher than normal. It works by reducing the processor's power consumption if the programmed thermal temperature is exceeded. Intel Flex Memory Access This Intel technology makes upgrading easier by "allowing different memory sizes to be populated and remain in dual-channel mode," according to Intel. Intel IPT Identity Protection Technology Designed to provide another layer of online security, Intel IPT  works by partnering with websites to help keep your personal information safe when you log in to your favorite IPT-enabled sites like shopping, bill paying, banking, etc. Intel IPT verifies your log-in, confirms you're using a trusted device, and protects your account from being accessed without your recognized device. The processor contains a thermal diode which measures the actual CPU temperature and relays its temperature and thermal requirements to the motherboard. The motherboard uses those requirements to control the processor fan and ensure it does not spin faster than necessary - even under worst case power use. Intel SIPP Intel's Stable Image Platform Program is designed to make the transition between technology generations more predictable. With SIPP, you wont' have to worry about changes to key platform components or drivers for an established period of time, according to Intel. This means fewer hardware changes, making your life less complicated and possibly saving you money, during the Intel SIPP time frame. Visit intel.com for more information.

Intel processors use AES in addition to a set of six new instructions to enable hardware to do some of the work of AES, thereby accelerating its execution by three to 10 times compared with relying solely on software. Intel Secure Key Intel Secure Key is a feature designed to keep your data and personal information safe by strengthening encryption capability via a digital random number generator. Intel Software Guard Extensions This set of CPU instructions provides applications the ability to create a secure area in which to protect data from access by other rogue software. Intel Trusted Execution Technology Trusted Execution Technology, or TXT, is just one of the ways Intel is working to keep your system more safe. This technology, when combined with an Intel TXT enabled operating system, uses hardware enhancements to protect your data and your privacy by defending against software-based attacks. Execute Disable Bit Reduces your system's exposure to viruses and mal-ware attacks, and the chances of self-executing and propagating software from taking down your system or network. That can save you costly repairs, lost productivity, and revenue. 10/100/1000 Gigabit Network Just when you thought life couldn't go any faster, technology changed the rules. Using more bandwidth and full-duplex capacity, the 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet will have you connecting with the Internet or your other devices faster than you can say gigabit. Bluetooth® 4.0 Also known as Bluetooth Smart Ready, it takes wireless communication to a whole new level. First, it's compatible with a large number of devices like tablets, smart phones, and of course computers, but it's also compatible with TV remotes, and even appliances. All of these things will be controlled using apps, so the ability to turn on the lights or your oven before you get home will be as easy as picking up your cellphone. In addition, it uses considerably less power.
