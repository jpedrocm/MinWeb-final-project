It's ideal for social media, making notes, email, and shopping online. 2 in 1 The Pavilion x2 is a 2 in 1 - a versatile laptop/tablet hybrid that gives you the best of both worlds. You can browse the web, watch films and update your social media in tablet mode and, with a simple click, attach the keyboard to accurately type up essays or reports. The screen also rotates around the base, so you can stand the x2 up and watch films and other media completely hands-free. Microsoft Office The  Pavilion x2 comes with a free one-year subscription to Microsoft Office Mobile. This gives you access to Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Access, so you can get to work right-away without having to buy any other software. Whether you're a student or buying for business, you can access your most used PC software from anywhere. Work all day wirelessly Whether you're at work, on a long journey or spending a lazy day on the sofa, you won't need to keep the charger connected thanks to the 12 hour battery life. Carrying it around is effortless - the tablet and keyboard weight little just over a kilogram, while the tablet alone weighs half that, so you can slip it into a case or add to your luggage without it causing any noticeable difference. Convenient connections The Pavilion x2 features a USB-C port. An evolution of the normal USB port, it is smaller than previous generations and symmetrical, so you can plug cables and storage in first time, every time. A micro-HDMI port makes it simple to connect to monitors, TVs and projectors. Micro-HDMI supports audio too, so you only need to connect one cable to share videos, presentations and more of a bigger screen. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

It's ideal for social media, making notes, email, and shopping online. 2 in 1 The Pavilion x2 is a 2 in 1 - a versatile laptop/tablet hybrid that gives you the best of both worlds. You can browse the web, watch films and update your social media in tablet mode and, with a simple click, attach the keyboard to accurately type up essays or reports. The screen also rotates around the base, so you can stand the x2 up and watch films and other media completely hands-free. Microsoft Office The  Pavilion x2 comes with a free one-year subscription to Microsoft Office Mobile. This gives you access to Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Access, so you can get to work right-away without having to buy any other software. Whether you're a student or buying for business, you can access your most used PC software from anywhere. Work all day wirelessly Whether you're at work, on a long journey or spending a lazy day on the sofa, you won't need to keep the charger connected thanks to the 12 hour battery life. Carrying it around is effortless - the tablet and keyboard weight little just over a kilogram, while the tablet alone weighs half that, so you can slip it into a case or add to your luggage without it causing any noticeable difference. Convenient connections The Pavilion x2 features a USB-C port. An evolution of the normal USB port, it is smaller than previous generations and symmetrical, so you can plug cables and storage in first time, every time. A micro-HDMI port makes it simple to connect to monitors, TVs and projectors. Micro-HDMI supports audio too, so you only need to connect one cable to share videos, presentations and more of a bigger screen. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want.

You can browse the web, watch films and update your social media in tablet mode and, with a simple click, attach the keyboard to accurately type up essays or reports. The screen also rotates around the base, so you can stand the x2 up and watch films and other media completely hands-free. Microsoft Office The  Pavilion x2 comes with a free one-year subscription to Microsoft Office Mobile. This gives you access to Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Access, so you can get to work right-away without having to buy any other software. Whether you're a student or buying for business, you can access your most used PC software from anywhere. Work all day wirelessly Whether you're at work, on a long journey or spending a lazy day on the sofa, you won't need to keep the charger connected thanks to the 12 hour battery life. Carrying it around is effortless - the tablet and keyboard weight little just over a kilogram, while the tablet alone weighs half that, so you can slip it into a case or add to your luggage without it causing any noticeable difference. Convenient connections The Pavilion x2 features a USB-C port. An evolution of the normal USB port, it is smaller than previous generations and symmetrical, so you can plug cables and storage in first time, every time. A micro-HDMI port makes it simple to connect to monitors, TVs and projectors. Micro-HDMI supports audio too, so you only need to connect one cable to share videos, presentations and more of a bigger screen. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Bundles 2 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Highlights - Detachable keyboard lets you work the way you want - 12 hour battery life lets you work all day without charging - USB-C port makes it simple to connect to other devices - Lightweight construction makes it super-portable Social The HP Pavilion x2 is part of our Social range, which features great-value laptops designed to keep you connected to what matters. It's ideal for social media, making notes, email, and shopping online. 2 in 1 The Pavilion x2 is a 2 in 1 - a versatile laptop/tablet hybrid that gives you the best of both worlds. You can browse the web, watch films and update your social media in tablet mode and, with a simple click, attach the keyboard to accurately type up essays or reports. The screen also rotates around the base, so you can stand the x2 up and watch films and other media completely hands-free. Microsoft Office The  Pavilion x2 comes with a free one-year subscription to Microsoft Office Mobile. This gives you access to Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Access, so you can get to work right-away without having to buy any other software. Whether you're a student or buying for business, you can access your most used PC software from anywhere. Work all day wirelessly Whether you're at work, on a long journey or spending a lazy day on the sofa, you won't need to keep the charger connected thanks to the 12 hour battery life. Carrying it around is effortless - the tablet and keyboard weight little just over a kilogram, while the tablet alone weighs half that, so you can slip it into a case or add to your luggage without it causing any noticeable difference. Convenient connections The Pavilion x2 features a USB-C port. An evolution of the normal USB port, it is smaller than previous generations and symmetrical, so you can plug cables and storage in first time, every time. A micro-HDMI port makes it simple to connect to monitors, TVs and projectors. Micro-HDMI supports audio too, so you only need to connect one cable to share videos, presentations and more of a bigger screen. Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
