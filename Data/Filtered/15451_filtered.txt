Product information Specification Customer reviews Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 6 Product information - Portable laptop designed for everyday computing on the go - Chrome OS is easy to use and gives you access to your documents from anywhere - From streaming films to shopping online, the Full HD screen delivers detailed visuals - Work for longer between charges thanks to the 11 hour battery life Convenient portable computing The Chromebook 13 is a laptop designed for working on the go. Rather than save important files to the hard drive where they can be lost or accidently deleted, the Chromebook 13 keeps your data safe in the Cloud. From business documents to films, all of your documents are easily accessible when you need them.  This is handy if you also work on another computer or tablet as you can simply save a file to the Cloud and access it instantly from your Chromebook. It's compatible with all types of Cloud storage too, including OneDrive and Knowhow Cloud. Full HD screen With the same resolution as many TVs, the Full HD screen means screen quality isn't compromised when you're working on the go. Text is displayed clearly for easy reading while images have sharp detail and bright colours - great for students taking notes in lectures and working in seminars.  All day computing You can forget scrambling for a charger during meetings or halfway through a film thanks to the Chromebook's 11 hour battery life. Plus, built-in internet security keeps you and your files safe online and means you can get started without needing to buy any extra software.
