It has a huge 8 GB of dedicated video RAM, so there's no question about whether it'll run your favourite and most anticipated games at their best. From the biggest triple-A titles such as Fallout 4 to classics like Half-Life, you can turn up the graphics to maximum and play any game available today without compromise. Built for gaming There's no need to worry about whether the processor can keep up with the graphics card. Powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor, the Defiance II is more than ready for this and the next generation of gaming. And when combined with the vast 24 GB of RAM, the Defiance effortlessly runs industry-standard design, media editing, and music production software, so you can game and create from one impressively powerful machine.

Product information Specification Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Highlights - Incredibly powerful gaming laptop delivers desktop performance, anywhere - NVIDA GeForce GTX 980M graphics card runs the latest games at max settings with high FPS - Quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor runs the latest games and demanding software flawlessly - Hard drive & SSD combine high capacity and performance storage for fast, responsive computing NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M You'll experience the latest games with impressive Full HD visuals and smooth frames-per-second thanks to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M graphics card. It has a huge 8 GB of dedicated video RAM, so there's no question about whether it'll run your favourite and most anticipated games at their best. From the biggest triple-A titles such as Fallout 4 to classics like Half-Life, you can turn up the graphics to maximum and play any game available today without compromise. Built for gaming There's no need to worry about whether the processor can keep up with the graphics card. Powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor, the Defiance II is more than ready for this and the next generation of gaming. And when combined with the vast 24 GB of RAM, the Defiance effortlessly runs industry-standard design, media editing, and music production software, so you can game and create from one impressively powerful machine. Dual storage Most laptops either have a large capacity hard drive, or a high-performance solid-state drive. The Defiance II has both. This allows you storage large amounts of data, such as music and films, on hard drive and save the SSD for games. Any games installed on the SSD will run smoother and benefit from significantly reduced loading times - great for quickly getting into the action when playing huge open world games. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
