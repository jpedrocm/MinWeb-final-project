Unique watchband hinge Need a laptop but don't want to sacrifice the ease of tablet computing? The YOGA 900S has you covered thanks to its unique watchband hinge, which allows the screen to rotate completely around the base. You can type essays in laptop mode and then switch the screen round to shop online or play touchscreen games when you need a break. The watchband hinge is allows the YOGA to be super-slim so, unlike many 2 in 1s, you can actually use it like a tablet. There are two stand modes too for streaming films or browsing on your lap in complete comfort. All day, everyday computing Whether you spend the day writing reports, editing photos, or chatting to friends, the YOGA 900S lets you do it all day without charging thanks to a 10.5 hour battery life. One of the reasons the battery life is so good is that it's powered by an Intel® Core™ m7 processor. This advanced processor matches the speed it runs at with the task at hand to make sure it's never using too much batter.  However, when you need fast processing for demanding tasks like photo editing and recording music, it turns up the clock speed to give you fast and responsive computing. Backlit AccuType Keyboard The YOGA 900S is ideal if you spend a lot of time typing essays and projects. The AccuType keyboard has ergonomic keys designed to keep you comfortable when typing even the longest documents. It's backlit too to keep your typing accurate in even the darkest rooms.

Product information Specification Customer reviews Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Top features: - 360° rotating screen with unique watchband hinge switches from laptop to tablet mode in seconds - 10+ hour battery life keeps you working all day without charging - Powerful Intel® Core™ m7 processing delivers fast yet efficient computing for demanding tasks - Backlit AccuType keyboard keeps you productive and accurate when typing in any light Style The YOGA 900S is part of our Style range, which has beautifully-crafted premium PCs designed to impress. Along with everyday computing, it's great for photo & video editing, working on the go, business use, and multimedia. Unique watchband hinge Need a laptop but don't want to sacrifice the ease of tablet computing? The YOGA 900S has you covered thanks to its unique watchband hinge, which allows the screen to rotate completely around the base. You can type essays in laptop mode and then switch the screen round to shop online or play touchscreen games when you need a break. The watchband hinge is allows the YOGA to be super-slim so, unlike many 2 in 1s, you can actually use it like a tablet. There are two stand modes too for streaming films or browsing on your lap in complete comfort. All day, everyday computing Whether you spend the day writing reports, editing photos, or chatting to friends, the YOGA 900S lets you do it all day without charging thanks to a 10.5 hour battery life. One of the reasons the battery life is so good is that it's powered by an Intel® Core™ m7 processor. This advanced processor matches the speed it runs at with the task at hand to make sure it's never using too much batter.  However, when you need fast processing for demanding tasks like photo editing and recording music, it turns up the clock speed to give you fast and responsive computing. Backlit AccuType Keyboard The YOGA 900S is ideal if you spend a lot of time typing essays and projects. The AccuType keyboard has ergonomic keys designed to keep you comfortable when typing even the longest documents. It's backlit too to keep your typing accurate in even the darkest rooms. Microsoft Office & Internet security The YOGA 900S doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.   Specification Technical specifications for LENOVO YOGA 900S 12.5" 2 in 1 - Silver OVERVIEW Type 2 in 1 Operating system Windows 10 (64-bit) SPECIFICATION Processor - Intel® Core™ m7-6Y75 Processor - Dual-core - 1.2 GHz / 3.1 GHz (Turbo Boost) - 4 MB cache Memory (RAM) 8 GB LPDDR3 Storage 256 GB SSD SCREEN Touchscreen 10-point multitouch screen Screen size 12.5" Screen type IPS Resolution 2560 x 1440 Screen features Anti-glare CONNECTIVITY Wireless 802.11 ac Ethernet No Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.0 USB - USB-C x 1 - USB 3.0 x 1 - USB 2.0 x 1 Video interface USB-C Audio interface 3.5 mm jack MEDIA Optical disc drive No Memory card reader No SOUND Sound Dolby Audio Premium Speakers Integrated stereo speakers FEATURES Camera Integrated webcam Microphone Yes Mouse / trackpad Multitouch glass trackpad Keyboard Backlit AccuType keyboard POWER Battery type 4-cell Lithium-Polymer, 53 WHr Battery life Up to 10.5 hours GENERAL Colour Silver Box contents - Lenovo YOGA 900S 12.5" 2 in 1 - AC power adapter - User manual Dimensions 13 x 305 x 208 mm (H x W x D) Weight 999 g Manufacturer’s guarantee 1 year Software included * Full version of Microsoft Office not included * Full version of anti-virus / internet security not included Customer reviews Customer reviews Ask an owner Reviews of PC World Lenovo Yoga 900S reviews verified by reevoo 12 reviews Reviews from: All purchasersBusiness userGeneral home userOften on the moveOther Sort by: Most recentMost helpfulLowest scoreHighest score (7.3 out of 10) Battery life 8.1 Design 8.8 Size and weight 9.8 Performance 7.4 Value for money 6.1 Overall rating 7.3 Scores 7.3 out of 10 based on 12 reviews Show more score details Previous 1 2 3 Next Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Delivering your online order Get this delivered on a day to suit you At PC World we deliver 7 days a week.
