It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making. 2 in 1 design Combining the functionality of a laptop with the touchscreen and portability of a tablet, the Envy x360 has a flexible yet durable hinge so that you can choose between four unique modes: Laptop mode lets you use the keyboard and trackpad as usual to write essays and emails, whilst Tablet mode tucks the keyboard away behind the screen and turns the keyboard off, making it as easy to use and navigate as a standard tablet. Stand and Tent modes let you use the keyboard as a stand, so that you can watch films, work on the touchscreen and more. Reliable computing for everyday Edit photos or work on an essay wherever you are with the reliable power of the AMD A12 APU. Aided by 8 GB of memory, the Envy x360 can effortlessly run multiple applications and power photo editing programs. And with AMD Radeon R7 Graphics, every image looks great whether it's your holiday photos, a new game or your favourite film. Full HD touchscreen Enjoy films, catch up on TV shows and make every image look great with the immersive Full HD screen. Offering an extra-wide viewing angle and a responsive, easy to navigate touchscreen, the crisp screen is perfect for amplifying all of your entertainment. Windows Hello The HP TrueVision IR camera is compatible with Windows Hello, a new feature built into Windows 10, which automatically unlocks your Windows account by scanning your face. When you (and only you) sit down in front of your PC, it unlocks immediately without a password, then locks again when you move away.   Custom-tuned audio Enjoy rich, authentic sound no matter what you listen to with Dual HP speakers, HP Audio Boost and custom tuning by Bang & Olufsen. Designed to enhance all your audio, the technology is specially created for crisp and true to life sound. Microsoft Office & internet security The HP Pavilion x360 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security.

It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making. 2 in 1 design Combining the functionality of a laptop with the touchscreen and portability of a tablet, the Envy x360 has a flexible yet durable hinge so that you can choose between four unique modes: Laptop mode lets you use the keyboard and trackpad as usual to write essays and emails, whilst Tablet mode tucks the keyboard away behind the screen and turns the keyboard off, making it as easy to use and navigate as a standard tablet. Stand and Tent modes let you use the keyboard as a stand, so that you can watch films, work on the touchscreen and more. Reliable computing for everyday Edit photos or work on an essay wherever you are with the reliable power of the AMD A12 APU. Aided by 8 GB of memory, the Envy x360 can effortlessly run multiple applications and power photo editing programs.

Full HD touchscreen Enjoy films, catch up on TV shows and make every image look great with the immersive Full HD screen. Offering an extra-wide viewing angle and a responsive, easy to navigate touchscreen, the crisp screen is perfect for amplifying all of your entertainment. Windows Hello The HP TrueVision IR camera is compatible with Windows Hello, a new feature built into Windows 10, which automatically unlocks your Windows account by scanning your face. When you (and only you) sit down in front of your PC, it unlocks immediately without a password, then locks again when you move away.   Custom-tuned audio Enjoy rich, authentic sound no matter what you listen to with Dual HP speakers, HP Audio Boost and custom tuning by Bang & Olufsen. Designed to enhance all your audio, the technology is specially created for crisp and true to life sound. Microsoft Office & internet security The HP Pavilion x360 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security.
