Quality control issues This laptop seemed to tick all the boxes and looks great as well. However the keyboard layout just isn't right with the location of the right shift key to the right of the arrow keys. You end up hitting the wrong key and have to relearn how to type. Not very convenient when switching between computers. Why they couldn't just move the arrow keys down like everyone else is puzzling. Online reviews point this out but it really is a bigger deal and not something that many would be happy with. I also had to return mine due to a quality control issue - there was a gap in the rear casing. Not really what you want when you had to wait patiently for 3 weeks for it to arrive in the first place. Not happy. Date published: 2016-08-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by MrBlubba from Excellent laptop I fully believe this to be the best laptop ive ever owned. I have gone through several laptops in the past few years but this is by far the best one ive had. This thing replaced my X140e which was quite bulky. There are a lot of good things about this laptop PROS: Magnesium top cover and aluminum frame backlit keys the keyboard is amazing. i love the full size arrow keys massive glass touchpad that feels great the screen is bright and very vivid. The screen is so good it makes windows 10 actually look nice. its super slim and light great specs reasonable price it has a fan! CONS: windows 10. I find windows 10 bloated and ugly. Had to spend several hours making it work the way it should out of the box. Linux is the future and its free. The power brick is a lil weird. Its basically a giant square with the plugins sticking out of one side. Other than those things- not even related to the computer itself- this thing is an amazing laptop and totally worth the 800 dollar price tag. Date published: 2016-05-04 Rated 1 out of 5 by WarningU2 from Returning Laptop I ordered in mid-May but it was delayed shipment until first week of June due to demand. I received 10 day ago. Laptop would not wake up from sleep after day 1. Support was very helpful but despite our best efforts it won't boot at all now. I suspect the graphics adapter has failed. I'm returning the laptop as I have no confidence in it. It's light, beautiful looking and fast but the exterior casing is flimsy and the keyboard layout is odd, kept hitting up-key instead of shift. It also got surprisingly hot after a couple of hours of use. Battery has good life.

If so, can Linux be installed? Asked by: PMGH Unfortunately Linux isn't supported. This computer seemed like a perfect fit for me as Lenovo has always had excellent build quality and value, but they no longer support Linux on this laptop. Really, really sucks. Answered by: aspiringengineer Date published: 2016-08-23 Does it have an Ethernet cable Asked by: luckie No it does not. I assume you are asking about an ethernet port, not the cable itself. No port.

Quality control issues This laptop seemed to tick all the boxes and looks great as well. However the keyboard layout just isn't right with the location of the right shift key to the right of the arrow keys. You end up hitting the wrong key and have to relearn how to type. Not very convenient when switching between computers. Why they couldn't just move the arrow keys down like everyone else is puzzling. Online reviews point this out but it really is a bigger deal and not something that many would be happy with. I also had to return mine due to a quality control issue - there was a gap in the rear casing. Not really what you want when you had to wait patiently for 3 weeks for it to arrive in the first place. Not happy. Date published: 2016-08-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by MrBlubba from Excellent laptop I fully believe this to be the best laptop ive ever owned. I have gone through several laptops in the past few years but this is by far the best one ive had. This thing replaced my X140e which was quite bulky. There are a lot of good things about this laptop PROS: Magnesium top cover and aluminum frame backlit keys the keyboard is amazing. i love the full size arrow keys massive glass touchpad that feels great the screen is bright and very vivid. The screen is so good it makes windows 10 actually look nice. its super slim and light great specs reasonable price it has a fan! CONS: windows 10. I find windows 10 bloated and ugly. Had to spend several hours making it work the way it should out of the box. Linux is the future and its free. The power brick is a lil weird. Its basically a giant square with the plugins sticking out of one side. Other than those things- not even related to the computer itself- this thing is an amazing laptop and totally worth the 800 dollar price tag. Date published: 2016-05-04 Rated 1 out of 5 by WarningU2 from Returning Laptop I ordered in mid-May but it was delayed shipment until first week of June due to demand. I received 10 day ago. Laptop would not wake up from sleep after day 1. Support was very helpful but despite our best efforts it won't boot at all now. I suspect the graphics adapter has failed. I'm returning the laptop as I have no confidence in it. It's light, beautiful looking and fast but the exterior casing is flimsy and the keyboard layout is odd, kept hitting up-key instead of shift. It also got surprisingly hot after a couple of hours of use. Battery has good life.

If so, can Linux be installed? Asked by: PMGH Unfortunately Linux isn't supported. This computer seemed like a perfect fit for me as Lenovo has always had excellent build quality and value, but they no longer support Linux on this laptop. Really, really sucks. Answered by: aspiringengineer Date published: 2016-08-23 Does it have an Ethernet cable Asked by: luckie No it does not. I assume you are asking about an ethernet port, not the cable itself. No port.

Rated 1 out of 5 by jb82 from Poor key layout. Quality control issues This laptop seemed to tick all the boxes and looks great as well. However the keyboard layout just isn't right with the location of the right shift key to the right of the arrow keys. You end up hitting the wrong key and have to relearn how to type. Not very convenient when switching between computers. Why they couldn't just move the arrow keys down like everyone else is puzzling. Online reviews point this out but it really is a bigger deal and not something that many would be happy with. I also had to return mine due to a quality control issue - there was a gap in the rear casing. Not really what you want when you had to wait patiently for 3 weeks for it to arrive in the first place. Not happy. Date published: 2016-08-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by MrBlubba from Excellent laptop I fully believe this to be the best laptop ive ever owned. I have gone through several laptops in the past few years but this is by far the best one ive had. This thing replaced my X140e which was quite bulky. There are a lot of good things about this laptop PROS: Magnesium top cover and aluminum frame backlit keys the keyboard is amazing. i love the full size arrow keys massive glass touchpad that feels great the screen is bright and very vivid. The screen is so good it makes windows 10 actually look nice. its super slim and light great specs reasonable price it has a fan! CONS: windows 10. I find windows 10 bloated and ugly. Had to spend several hours making it work the way it should out of the box. Linux is the future and its free. The power brick is a lil weird. Its basically a giant square with the plugins sticking out of one side. Other than those things- not even related to the computer itself- this thing is an amazing laptop and totally worth the 800 dollar price tag. Date published: 2016-05-04 Rated 1 out of 5 by WarningU2 from Returning Laptop I ordered in mid-May but it was delayed shipment until first week of June due to demand. I received 10 day ago. Laptop would not wake up from sleep after day 1. Support was very helpful but despite our best efforts it won't boot at all now. I suspect the graphics adapter has failed. I'm returning the laptop as I have no confidence in it. It's light, beautiful looking and fast but the exterior casing is flimsy and the keyboard layout is odd, kept hitting up-key instead of shift. It also got surprisingly hot after a couple of hours of use. Battery has good life.

Hi, Is the BIOS locked down? If so, can Linux be installed? Asked by: PMGH Unfortunately Linux isn't supported.
