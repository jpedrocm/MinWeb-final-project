I love my ThinkPad x260. I needed a machine with a decent keyboard, great battery life, nice FHD screen and durability for on-the-road work. It meets these requirements in spades. Build quality is excellent. The machine is solid as a rock. Performance is outstanding with my selection of the Core i5-6200U processor. Do yourself a favor and don't get the standard hard drive -- get it configured with an SSD. The FHD IPS screen is lovely and provides great viewing at any angle and thanks to a matte screen, it's actually usable in rooms with strong lighting overhead or outside. The battery life is mind boggling. I get upwards of 20 hours with the 9-cell external battery attached. I can get 11 or so with just the 3-cell external attached. With more than one swappable battery, I could work for a full 24 hours straight without plugging in. I highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by elnous from This is a lovely but strong machine! Today I received my computer and is even more beautiful than what was seen on the web. The ending is perfect, and has the size and weight imagined as read in the description. The charger is very compact and lightweight, ideal to carry around another without problems or additional discomfort. The display hinge is very strong, and the frame does not support one finger directly on it to open it. The performance is great, on and off really very, very fast, and being always ready when you need it, or when you need to go on the road. The only downside: I thought it came with backlit keyboard, but it was not. The rest, a luxury. Date published: 2016-07-30 Rated 5 out of 5 by chatnoir352 from Love it I'm a long time thinkpad X owner and had been holding off until they produced one with 16 GB of RAM. They did, and I bought one. I've only had it for a couple of weeks now, so keep this in mind as you read my review. I got it with Windows 10, the solid state 512 GB drive, the HD IPS display, and the 72 WH 6-cell rear battery. So far, so good! Startup is super fast (combination of solid state drive and "fresh" operating system?). Battery life is excellent. The display is great - Not really sure about the other post that said it looked "muddy" and pixelated. A great upgrade from my x220 that was running Windows 7!

I love my ThinkPad x260. I needed a machine with a decent keyboard, great battery life, nice FHD screen and durability for on-the-road work. It meets these requirements in spades. Build quality is excellent. The machine is solid as a rock. Performance is outstanding with my selection of the Core i5-6200U processor. Do yourself a favor and don't get the standard hard drive -- get it configured with an SSD. The FHD IPS screen is lovely and provides great viewing at any angle and thanks to a matte screen, it's actually usable in rooms with strong lighting overhead or outside. The battery life is mind boggling. I get upwards of 20 hours with the 9-cell external battery attached. I can get 11 or so with just the 3-cell external attached. With more than one swappable battery, I could work for a full 24 hours straight without plugging in. I highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by elnous from This is a lovely but strong machine! Today I received my computer and is even more beautiful than what was seen on the web. The ending is perfect, and has the size and weight imagined as read in the description. The charger is very compact and lightweight, ideal to carry around another without problems or additional discomfort. The display hinge is very strong, and the frame does not support one finger directly on it to open it. The performance is great, on and off really very, very fast, and being always ready when you need it, or when you need to go on the road. The only downside: I thought it came with backlit keyboard, but it was not. The rest, a luxury. Date published: 2016-07-30 Rated 5 out of 5 by chatnoir352 from Love it I'm a long time thinkpad X owner and had been holding off until they produced one with 16 GB of RAM. They did, and I bought one. I've only had it for a couple of weeks now, so keep this in mind as you read my review. I got it with Windows 10, the solid state 512 GB drive, the HD IPS display, and the 72 WH 6-cell rear battery. So far, so good! Startup is super fast (combination of solid state drive and "fresh" operating system?). Battery life is excellent. The display is great - Not really sure about the other post that said it looked "muddy" and pixelated. A great upgrade from my x220 that was running Windows 7!

Asked by: rafaat5 No you have to use a dongle only has mini DP port. Answered by: peugeot Date published: 2016-03-03 If I only buy the ThinkPad X260 itself, does it come with a charger/ power adaptor already? Asked by: Hong Ha Yes. It's a small, portable charger but it does the trick. Answered by: TomTheITGuy Date published: 2016-09-23 Are they going to come out with a touch screen for the X260? When if yes?

Rated 5 out of 5 by Nerp from The best laptop I've owned. I love my ThinkPad x260. I needed a machine with a decent keyboard, great battery life, nice FHD screen and durability for on-the-road work. It meets these requirements in spades. Build quality is excellent. The machine is solid as a rock. Performance is outstanding with my selection of the Core i5-6200U processor. Do yourself a favor and don't get the standard hard drive -- get it configured with an SSD. The FHD IPS screen is lovely and provides great viewing at any angle and thanks to a matte screen, it's actually usable in rooms with strong lighting overhead or outside. The battery life is mind boggling. I get upwards of 20 hours with the 9-cell external battery attached. I can get 11 or so with just the 3-cell external attached. With more than one swappable battery, I could work for a full 24 hours straight without plugging in. I highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by elnous from This is a lovely but strong machine! Today I received my computer and is even more beautiful than what was seen on the web. The ending is perfect, and has the size and weight imagined as read in the description. The charger is very compact and lightweight, ideal to carry around another without problems or additional discomfort. The display hinge is very strong, and the frame does not support one finger directly on it to open it. The performance is great, on and off really very, very fast, and being always ready when you need it, or when you need to go on the road. The only downside: I thought it came with backlit keyboard, but it was not. The rest, a luxury. Date published: 2016-07-30 Rated 5 out of 5 by chatnoir352 from Love it I'm a long time thinkpad X owner and had been holding off until they produced one with 16 GB of RAM. They did, and I bought one. I've only had it for a couple of weeks now, so keep this in mind as you read my review. I got it with Windows 10, the solid state 512 GB drive, the HD IPS display, and the 72 WH 6-cell rear battery. So far, so good! Startup is super fast (combination of solid state drive and "fresh" operating system?). Battery life is excellent. The display is great - Not really sure about the other post that said it looked "muddy" and pixelated. A great upgrade from my x220 that was running Windows 7!

With more than one swappable battery, I could work for a full 24 hours straight without plugging in. I highly recommend this laptop. Date published: 2016-05-23

The best laptop I've owned.
I love my ThinkPad x260. I needed a machine with a decent keyboard, great battery life, nice FHD screen and durability for on-the-road work. It meets these requirements in spades. Build quality is excellent. The machine is solid as a rock. Performance is outstanding with my selection of the Core i5-6200U processor. Do yourself a favor and don't get the standard hard drive -- get it configured with an SSD.

Rated 5 out of 5 by elnous from This is a lovely but strong machine! Today I received my computer and is even more beautiful than what was seen on the web. The ending is perfect, and has the size and weight imagined as read in the description. The charger is very compact and lightweight, ideal to carry around another without problems or additional discomfort. The display hinge is very strong, and the frame does not support one finger directly on it to open it. The performance is great, on and off really very, very fast, and being always ready when you need it, or when you need to go on the road. The only downside: I thought it came with backlit keyboard, but it was not. The rest, a luxury. Date published: 2016-07-30

Rated 5 out of 5 by chatnoir352 from Love it I'm a long time thinkpad X owner and had been holding off until they produced one with 16 GB of RAM. They did, and I bought one. I've only had it for a couple of weeks now, so keep this in mind as you read my review. I got it with Windows 10, the solid state 512 GB drive, the HD IPS display, and the 72 WH 6-cell rear battery. So far, so good! Startup is super fast (combination of solid state drive and "fresh" operating system?). Battery life is excellent. The display is great - Not really sure about the other post that said it looked "muddy" and pixelated. A great upgrade from my x220 that was running Windows 7! Date published: 2016-04-08
