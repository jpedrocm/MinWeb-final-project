A FULL GUI BIOS with full mouse control gives you complete control over all aspects of performance, voltage and advanced settings right at your fingertips. Not to mention, a Clear CMOS button directly on the chassis, this is the world’s first TRUE overclocking laptop.
A sleek design rounds out the package with a full unibody chassis, and slim design that is under 1.05in at its thickest point. This is just the beginning. USB 3.1 Type C, excellent sound with an integrated subwoofer, and a beautiful 4K 17” display is what you get when you cross performance with art.
