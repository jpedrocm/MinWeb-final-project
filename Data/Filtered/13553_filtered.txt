Please contact your local dealers or retailers for the latest product information. HDMI 2.0: Higher Frame Rate, Higher Potential The era of true 4K Ultra-HD is upon us! The untapped potential of 4K resolutions is realized through HDMI 2.0! Unlike HDMI 1.4 which only supports 8-bit color and 30 FPS, HDMI 2.0 can display games like never before! Supporting up to 18 Gbps transfer, the true potential of 4K resolution is realized through 12-bit color and 60Hz refresh rate! Finally see your favorite games how they were meant to be seen, in true high definition! *Requires HDCP 2.2 supported monitors. USB 3.1 Type-C - Upgraded Convenience The frustrations of turning a USB over and over trying to get it to plug has ended. With the introduction of USB 3.1 Type-C universal connector, connecting a USB is no longer a fuss. Not only is it easier to plug, it also has twice the throughput of USB 3.0, transferring 100GB video in as little as 80 seconds. Being able to transfer data faster and possesses much improved pluggability greatly improves any user’s daily routine! Anti-ghost Backlit Keyboard - Never Miss an Action When too many keys on a traditional keyboard are pressed at once, you will experience “ghosting” that stops some keys from registering, which will cause an action to be executed incorrectly or at the wrong time. With P57 30-keys rollover keyboard, experience anti-ghosting with precise control of the keyboard no matter how many keys are held down at once. The backlit keyboard also allows gamers to play in the dark. Execute actions with ease and comfort. *Anti-ghosting does not include F1~F12 function keys. Multi-Usages - Swappable ODD/HDD Slot The ingenious design of the swappable ODD/HDD slot* brings more choices as well as opportunities for gamers. The swappable bay can take a DVD RW drive, Blu-ray drive or additional 2TB HDD. Ultimate customization creates unprecedented mobility. *Product specifications and product appearance may differ by country and region.

The backlit keyboard also allows gamers to play in the dark. Execute actions with ease and comfort.
