Touchscreen is reasonably bright and works well. Folding design is awesome. Keyboard is small, has some awkward key placement and shallow key travel. Not great for typing, but better than a virtual keyboard. It's really a nice enough computer. I only gave it 3-stars because my previous reviews with higher ratings were rejected with no explanation, but it seems they have no issue approving reviews with lower ratings. Weird. Date published: 2016-06-14 Rated 4 out of 5 by Eric James from Overall Satisfied: Recommend Finally got the laptop (been waiting for months) with the Core™ m7-6Y75 Processor last week. I must say it was a pretty wise marketing tactic by Lenovo for offering the m5, 4 GB memory, and 128 SSD for $100 less. 99% of people will get the highest version with the m7 chip no doubt. Overall, so far so good. I haven't run into any driver issues yet, and the 900s is a workhorse for being equipped with a 2nd gen mobile chip. Pros: Insanely lightweight, touchscreen, multitasking enterprise tasks, battery life, screen resolution, streaming quality, compliments from everyone Cons: Shift key placement (must retrain brain), it's a m7, not i7 Will update later after more usage... 8/10 "Recommend" Date published: 2016-05-31 Rated 4 out of 5 by Mads98 from Second try is a charm I had to return my first yoga 900s because the touch screen did not work, even though it came right out of the box. However, I just traded it in for another one and didn't have to pay a thing besides the original price. My second one works splendidly so far. I have had it for a short time, but there seems to be no problem with it as of this moment. I would recommend this laptop even though it does have some glitches. It has everything I ever wanted in a computer and I already love it! T Yes the keyboard is a bit awkward, but it is a 12" laptop and super thin. With that being said there has to be some give and takes.

Touchscreen is reasonably bright and works well. Folding design is awesome. Keyboard is small, has some awkward key placement and shallow key travel. Not great for typing, but better than a virtual keyboard. It's really a nice enough computer. I only gave it 3-stars because my previous reviews with higher ratings were rejected with no explanation, but it seems they have no issue approving reviews with lower ratings. Weird. Date published: 2016-06-14 Rated 4 out of 5 by Eric James from Overall Satisfied: Recommend Finally got the laptop (been waiting for months) with the Core™ m7-6Y75 Processor last week. I must say it was a pretty wise marketing tactic by Lenovo for offering the m5, 4 GB memory, and 128 SSD for $100 less. 99% of people will get the highest version with the m7 chip no doubt. Overall, so far so good. I haven't run into any driver issues yet, and the 900s is a workhorse for being equipped with a 2nd gen mobile chip. Pros: Insanely lightweight, touchscreen, multitasking enterprise tasks, battery life, screen resolution, streaming quality, compliments from everyone Cons: Shift key placement (must retrain brain), it's a m7, not i7 Will update later after more usage... 8/10 "Recommend" Date published: 2016-05-31 Rated 4 out of 5 by Mads98 from Second try is a charm I had to return my first yoga 900s because the touch screen did not work, even though it came right out of the box. However, I just traded it in for another one and didn't have to pay a thing besides the original price. My second one works splendidly so far. I have had it for a short time, but there seems to be no problem with it as of this moment. I would recommend this laptop even though it does have some glitches. It has everything I ever wanted in a computer and I already love it! T Yes the keyboard is a bit awkward, but it is a 12" laptop and super thin. With that being said there has to be some give and takes.

Can you tell me the exact USA release date (or at least more or less days) of Lenovo Yoga 900s? I have a second question; what kind of pens gonna be usable with 900s? Thank you Asked by: Tolga Ustun The pen is a digitizer - in terms of "type," that remains to be seen, but it's definitely NOT just an eraser-head style. Answered by: Samma Date published: 2016-04-30 Does Lenovo have a laptop like the Yoga 900 that has better graphics and more memory, like the 900, but digital pen support like the 900S Asked by: Timster Yes the thinkpad yoga 14 from best buy.

Rated 3 out of 5 by seekingultra from Nice, Except for Keyboard Favorable impressions based on how thin and light it is, and good performance in a fanless design. Touchscreen is reasonably bright and works well. Folding design is awesome. Keyboard is small, has some awkward key placement and shallow key travel. Not great for typing, but better than a virtual keyboard. It's really a nice enough computer. I only gave it 3-stars because my previous reviews with higher ratings were rejected with no explanation, but it seems they have no issue approving reviews with lower ratings. Weird. Date published: 2016-06-14 Rated 4 out of 5 by Eric James from Overall Satisfied: Recommend Finally got the laptop (been waiting for months) with the Core™ m7-6Y75 Processor last week. I must say it was a pretty wise marketing tactic by Lenovo for offering the m5, 4 GB memory, and 128 SSD for $100 less. 99% of people will get the highest version with the m7 chip no doubt. Overall, so far so good. I haven't run into any driver issues yet, and the 900s is a workhorse for being equipped with a 2nd gen mobile chip. Pros: Insanely lightweight, touchscreen, multitasking enterprise tasks, battery life, screen resolution, streaming quality, compliments from everyone Cons: Shift key placement (must retrain brain), it's a m7, not i7 Will update later after more usage... 8/10 "Recommend" Date published: 2016-05-31 Rated 4 out of 5 by Mads98 from Second try is a charm I had to return my first yoga 900s because the touch screen did not work, even though it came right out of the box. However, I just traded it in for another one and didn't have to pay a thing besides the original price. My second one works splendidly so far. I have had it for a short time, but there seems to be no problem with it as of this moment. I would recommend this laptop even though it does have some glitches. It has everything I ever wanted in a computer and I already love it! T Yes the keyboard is a bit awkward, but it is a 12" laptop and super thin. With that being said there has to be some give and takes.
