Solid yet lightweight design The X540 has a solid build without being bulky, finished with a smart brushed look that is sure to stand out wherever you are. Perfect for taking with you around the house with you, the lightweight chassis weighs only 1.9 kg. Prevent heat building up under the palm rest, the X540 has IceCool technology to keep the laptop surface comfortably cool, even after hours of use. USB-C Connectivity Connect faster than ever with the new USB Type-C port, which has a reversible design so you don't have to figure out which way to connect your USB devices. Able to transfer a 2 GB film in less than 2 seconds, USB Type-C lets you transfer at speeds of up to 5 GB/s. Audio and visual technology For precise, high quality sound, the X540 features SonicMaster technology. Professional software is paired with large speakers, an amplifier and resonance chambers for powerful audio and deep bass. Enjoy every song and watch movies with clear, fine-tuned audio. Asus Splendid Technology uses colour correction for richer, deeper colour to create great quality imagery. With four visual modes, you can optimise your screen to enhance every photo, video and film. If you're reading for a long period of time, Eye Care mode reduces the amount of fatiguing blue light. Microsoft Office & internet security The X540 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
