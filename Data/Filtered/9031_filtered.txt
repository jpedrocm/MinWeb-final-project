The first thing to impress me was the long battery life. I can use it on battery for 4 hours and still have about 50% remaining. Perfromance is good. Some of the keys have been moved around and I find my self deleting text when I want to do a page up. I'll have to get used to the new layout. One quirk is that occasionally while typing, the screen will freeze, go black and a message will appear "Display driver has stopped and has recovered". The online support says this is a known problem but there is no update for it. It is very disconcerning. The lighted keyboard is nice and the SSD is great. There are no indicator lights for the SSD or SD card which is okay but was helpfull in the past. Date published: 2016-07-05 Rated 2 out of 5 by Lordhappy from Converting from excellent to mediocre This is the 3rd Thinkpad I have owned and fail to understand why the keyboard had to be changed. Even worse is the removal of the two buttons below the touchpad. The keys still have the same travel as the T420S, but it just feels less substantial. I also wish their was a privacy slider for the camera. Nothing like gracing a $1400 laptop with a piece of tape to cover it up. Generally I feel like this is a huge step backwards in touch and feel from the other two I owned. I'm stuck with this one for the next few years I guess, and its a shame to feel that way for this price. Date published: 2016-08-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Dodge D from Sleek and Powerful I've had my T460p for just over a week and I'm *very* happy. The i7-6820HQ provides plenty of processing power for demanding tasks without sopping up the electrons for the light-weight stuff. And the WQHD display is gorgeous! The only small disappointment I have is with the keyboard layout; I would have preferred the "retro" layout of the T420 that I've since retired. But for 99% of my typing needs, the new keyboard is fast, has good tactile feedback, and I'm loving the back-light for those after dark sessions when I can't find the right key. I'm getting 5-6 hours on the 72Wh battery without doing anything special for power-saving measures, but I haven't been working the processor or graphics particularly hard either. It arrived in perfect shape and I've had no hardware issues. I've upgraded the RAM to 32GB and installed a 2TB SSD; this should last me a while. It was great working with Cory S, the Lenovo Inbound Sales Representative that helped me with my order. He really went the extra mile. So far, a great experience and an excellent notebook!

Asked by: ggoebel Officially, no. Unofficially, the M.2 slot supports SATA SSDs (if you don't get the WWAN option) and it is still to be seen if it supports NVMe. However since there are no M.2 NVMe 2242-sized SSDs available anywhere (they are all 2280-sized) you won't be able to try anyways.  Answered by: thaimin Date published: 2016-04-18 Does this laptop work on a Mini Dock Series 3 Lenovo Think Pad docking station? Asked by: Steve V Not sure. I have a new T460 and had a problem with the audio. I finally discovered that using display port to HDMI cables the system shuts off the audio jack from the Ultra Dock. And you must use monitor speakers or audio jack out of the monitor. Answered by: Donald Spokane Date published: 2016-09-16 Is there a disk drive in this laptop if not how much would one be Asked by: Drifter It comes with a single drive, either a hard drive (500 GB 7200 RPM) or a solid-state drive (from 128 GB to 512 GB). It does not accept a second hard drive, but unofficially supports a M.2 2242 SSD if you don't get the WWAN (cellular internet) option.

The first thing to impress me was the long battery life. I can use it on battery for 4 hours and still have about 50% remaining. Perfromance is good. Some of the keys have been moved around and I find my self deleting text when I want to do a page up. I'll have to get used to the new layout. One quirk is that occasionally while typing, the screen will freeze, go black and a message will appear "Display driver has stopped and has recovered". The online support says this is a known problem but there is no update for it. It is very disconcerning. The lighted keyboard is nice and the SSD is great. There are no indicator lights for the SSD or SD card which is okay but was helpfull in the past. Date published: 2016-07-05 Rated 2 out of 5 by Lordhappy from Converting from excellent to mediocre This is the 3rd Thinkpad I have owned and fail to understand why the keyboard had to be changed. Even worse is the removal of the two buttons below the touchpad. The keys still have the same travel as the T420S, but it just feels less substantial. I also wish their was a privacy slider for the camera. Nothing like gracing a $1400 laptop with a piece of tape to cover it up. Generally I feel like this is a huge step backwards in touch and feel from the other two I owned. I'm stuck with this one for the next few years I guess, and its a shame to feel that way for this price. Date published: 2016-08-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Dodge D from Sleek and Powerful I've had my T460p for just over a week and I'm *very* happy. The i7-6820HQ provides plenty of processing power for demanding tasks without sopping up the electrons for the light-weight stuff. And the WQHD display is gorgeous! The only small disappointment I have is with the keyboard layout; I would have preferred the "retro" layout of the T420 that I've since retired. But for 99% of my typing needs, the new keyboard is fast, has good tactile feedback, and I'm loving the back-light for those after dark sessions when I can't find the right key. I'm getting 5-6 hours on the 72Wh battery without doing anything special for power-saving measures, but I haven't been working the processor or graphics particularly hard either. It arrived in perfect shape and I've had no hardware issues. I've upgraded the RAM to 32GB and installed a 2TB SSD; this should last me a while. It was great working with Cory S, the Lenovo Inbound Sales Representative that helped me with my order. He really went the extra mile. So far, a great experience and an excellent notebook!

Asked by: ggoebel Officially, no. Unofficially, the M.2 slot supports SATA SSDs (if you don't get the WWAN option) and it is still to be seen if it supports NVMe. However since there are no M.2 NVMe 2242-sized SSDs available anywhere (they are all 2280-sized) you won't be able to try anyways.  Answered by: thaimin Date published: 2016-04-18 Does this laptop work on a Mini Dock Series 3 Lenovo Think Pad docking station? Asked by: Steve V Not sure. I have a new T460 and had a problem with the audio. I finally discovered that using display port to HDMI cables the system shuts off the audio jack from the Ultra Dock. And you must use monitor speakers or audio jack out of the monitor. Answered by: Donald Spokane Date published: 2016-09-16 Is there a disk drive in this laptop if not how much would one be Asked by: Drifter It comes with a single drive, either a hard drive (500 GB 7200 RPM) or a solid-state drive (from 128 GB to 512 GB). It does not accept a second hard drive, but unofficially supports a M.2 2242 SSD if you don't get the WWAN (cellular internet) option.

Rated 4 out of 5 by radioman1000 from Mostly good, a few quirks I replaced my 8 year old Z61t with the T460p and am very happy so far. The first thing to impress me was the long battery life. I can use it on battery for 4 hours and still have about 50% remaining. Perfromance is good. Some of the keys have been moved around and I find my self deleting text when I want to do a page up. I'll have to get used to the new layout. One quirk is that occasionally while typing, the screen will freeze, go black and a message will appear "Display driver has stopped and has recovered". The online support says this is a known problem but there is no update for it. It is very disconcerning. The lighted keyboard is nice and the SSD is great. There are no indicator lights for the SSD or SD card which is okay but was helpfull in the past. Date published: 2016-07-05 Rated 2 out of 5 by Lordhappy from Converting from excellent to mediocre This is the 3rd Thinkpad I have owned and fail to understand why the keyboard had to be changed. Even worse is the removal of the two buttons below the touchpad. The keys still have the same travel as the T420S, but it just feels less substantial. I also wish their was a privacy slider for the camera. Nothing like gracing a $1400 laptop with a piece of tape to cover it up. Generally I feel like this is a huge step backwards in touch and feel from the other two I owned. I'm stuck with this one for the next few years I guess, and its a shame to feel that way for this price. Date published: 2016-08-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Dodge D from Sleek and Powerful I've had my T460p for just over a week and I'm *very* happy. The i7-6820HQ provides plenty of processing power for demanding tasks without sopping up the electrons for the light-weight stuff. And the WQHD display is gorgeous! The only small disappointment I have is with the keyboard layout; I would have preferred the "retro" layout of the T420 that I've since retired. But for 99% of my typing needs, the new keyboard is fast, has good tactile feedback, and I'm loving the back-light for those after dark sessions when I can't find the right key. I'm getting 5-6 hours on the 72Wh battery without doing anything special for power-saving measures, but I haven't been working the processor or graphics particularly hard either. It arrived in perfect shape and I've had no hardware issues. I've upgraded the RAM to 32GB and installed a 2TB SSD; this should last me a while. It was great working with Cory S, the Lenovo Inbound Sales Representative that helped me with my order. He really went the extra mile. So far, a great experience and an excellent notebook!

Does the T460P support a PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD? Asked by: ggoebel Officially, no. Unofficially, the M.2 slot supports SATA SSDs (if you don't get the WWAN option) and it is still to be seen if it supports NVMe. However since there are no M.2 NVMe 2242-sized SSDs available anywhere (they are all 2280-sized) you won't be able to try anyways.  Answered by: thaimin Date published: 2016-04-18 Does this laptop work on a Mini Dock Series 3 Lenovo Think Pad docking station? Asked by: Steve V Not sure. I have a new T460 and had a problem with the audio. I finally discovered that using display port to HDMI cables the system shuts off the audio jack from the Ultra Dock. And you must use monitor speakers or audio jack out of the monitor. Answered by: Donald Spokane Date published: 2016-09-16 Is there a disk drive in this laptop if not how much would one be Asked by: Drifter It comes with a single drive, either a hard drive (500 GB 7200 RPM) or a solid-state drive (from 128 GB to 512 GB). It does not accept a second hard drive, but unofficially supports a M.2 2242 SSD if you don't get the WWAN (cellular internet) option.
