Impressive Storage and Memory With up to 1TB of storage, the ideapad 510 can handle all your photos and files.

In short, the ideapad 510 is the ultimate multimedia powerhouse. Vivid Visuals, Immersive Sound Watch your games pop in high res, kick back and enjoy a movie, or simply video chat–the 510 offers the visuals and sound you’re looking for.
