By Xander999 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I bought this product in April, and have only recently started attempting to use it for full functionality. Microsoft claims it can replace your desktop. This product works fine as a glorified web browser, but when tasked with actual work, like rendering or playing basic video games, it overheats non-stop. Its specifications are good but it cannot operate at anywhere close to the advertised functionality. This is not a good replacement for any of your devices. Microsoft should have stayed in the software business and not gone into hardware.

Doesn't wake from sleep. Battery life low. Heats up very very quickly. Oh and again...the screen does not RESPOND. No matter what I do the touch screen does not work even the PC itself says that it should be working fine.

It also gives me possibility to use papers for doing calculations and making notes: OneNote, Drawboard PDF are beautiful; *Great lifetime: notebook works during up to 13 hours from one charging. For example, by using Wolfram Mathematica, Firefox and LaTeX compiler I've discharged it within 11 hours; *Good performance: although it doesn't allow to play games smoothly (I can't play 2007 Crysis on highest specs), it gives usage of virtual machines, web-browsers with many opened tabs and Photoshop simultaneously without any issues (I use i7 16 Gb version); *Cool design. Be sure that pretty girls will pay attention on Surface Book owner. Although these advantages, this notebook have disadvantages. They are not huge, but makes me feel annoyed sometimes; *Bad coating. Initially matted corpse loses this property even with very accurate usage of notebook (I carry it in the special custom-made (leather, felt) case). *Soft magnesium metal. After taking the notebook in the hand after a significant (not excessive) contraction the bent has appeared on its corpse; *Wheezing left dynamic. This issue appeared, more or less on all Surface devices which I've owhed (SP 3, SP 4, SB); *Oleophobic coating defect. In my experience, among Surface devices this issue is happened only on SB (I've got two units). Precisely, on some part of the screen frame there are areas from which oiled spots from fingers look different and are hard to clean (in compare to "normal" areas); *Program part: even after all Anniversary Update, Intel Beta driver etc I can't make Firefox run as smooth as on old SP 3. Video playing eats many CPU resources (up to 100% for 4k video on YouTube), while on SP3 it eats up to 20%. *Center of mass isn't balanced. The screen part wobbles when I write down text with the stylus.

By Changito from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I got my product about a month ago for school, and found that I have been using it for my everyday life. It has made everything easier and the experience if using this device has been outstanding. Just one thing, it has no video memory which is really sucky because I cant play Xbox games on here.

I thought it would be perfect, but when I got it, I couldn't login in because it already had an account registered. Somehow I managed to pass it with the help of GOOGLE. As I just about to relax and get over with this login problem, my dad told me that he found the battery is dropping like real quick even after several times of full re-charging. AND one last disappointment---the connection of the charger is not always reliable, as it is extremely unstable. After all of this mess, I realized that this product could only be an unsuccessful renovating one. Unlucky for me and my dad,because we paid the for a brand-new Surface Book and instead got an old one.

I bought it and had the person at the Microsoft store set it up for me. He noticed there was an issue with it detaching so I had to return it because the screen was not detaching correctly. So no problem they switched it out for me. Then after that I thought I could go home and everything would be fine. Once I got home I tried to use it and the same issue occurred. I could not detach the screen. So I had to drive all the way back to the Microsoft store where I got it switched out again. It worked fine for a little bit then I realized when I detached the screen from the keyboard and reattached it the keyboard would not work so I either would have to attempt to detach it with the onscreen button which seldom worked or I had to completely restart it. The battery life is not what I thought it would be. It lasts much less than I thought. I do really enjoy the responsiveness of the pen and the note taking abilities. However I would not recommend the laptop and given the chance again I would buy one of the surface pros instead because of the cost and simple keyboard that just pops off unlike this annoying issue with disconnecting.

By Itaitheone from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It has been a year of using the Surface Book and i have no complains it is smooth, easy to use, sturdy and it even survived a motorcycle crash unlike the bike itself... although I even fell on the laptop. I love the battery life! I go out in the morning come back late home after working on only battery life it still has enough for me to run some tasks before it will ask me to plug it in. on average I get about 12-14 hours... yes I'm not joking. The pen is good a bit big but I love the fact that I can switch heads for different writing feeling. Resolution is amazing! Keyboard feels like the real deal and the touch pad is almost as functional as the mac one.

It is a great one obviously and I had a lot of fun using it. I had to exchange one. The fact that I chose exchange rather than return shows that I am still confident in this product.

Awe Man... In One Beautiful Device By Claywd from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It started with a Surface pro 4 and after 4 upgrades I ended up settling for the 512GB/i7/dGPU Surface Book. I am 95% happy with the device. Pros: - Fast: really fast. It rivals my Mac Pro which has been heavily upgraded. - Capable: Gaming? YES! AutoCAD? YES! Photoshop? YES! App Development? YES! Note Taking? YES PLEASE! - Seamless: most things are thought through and the device just works. Windows Hello rocks - Stylus: A++ - Thin & and Light: travels everywhere with me. Longboarding, School, Bus, Home Office, whatever. It works everywhere I need it. - Battery Life: Last ALL DAY! I have to work hard to make it die before I get my work done. - Display: Goodnight this display is right on. Photo's, videos, and colors are right on. Cons: - Every trackpad since the MacBook Pro allows for taping the touchpad even when navigating with other fingers simultaneously. Not this one... it's annoying. - No native Linux drivers: I know its a little techy but I have to have Linux and there is no support at this time other than Windows Subsystem for Linux. - Should add a magnetic plate to the top and right sides of the device so you can put your pen anywhere. - Beats, Skullcandy, etc. Headphone controls don't actually control the device. Kicks me out of that mobile tablet mode I get comfortable in when watching movies. - Thunderbolt is missing - USB-C is missing - MicroSD is missing. I've been using for 6 months and I wouldn't trade it for another device. I love it. I could love it more but I wouldn't give it up for anything other than a MacPro coupled with a iPad Pro. I still wouldn't be as happy though.

By Xander999 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I bought this product in April, and have only recently started attempting to use it for full functionality. Microsoft claims it can replace your desktop. This product works fine as a glorified web browser, but when tasked with actual work, like rendering or playing basic video games, it overheats non-stop. Its specifications are good but it cannot operate at anywhere close to the advertised functionality. This is not a good replacement for any of your devices. Microsoft should have stayed in the software business and not gone into hardware. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (1 of 4 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/28/2016   1.0 Poor Qualities By Not happy customer2133121 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: Screen stopped responding to touch. Doesn't wake from sleep. Battery life low. Heats up very very quickly. Oh and again...the screen does not RESPOND. No matter what I do the touch screen does not work even the PC itself says that it should be working fine. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/25/2016 (2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)   4.0 Beautiful in general, problematic in some details By Maksym_Ovchynnikov from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: *Beautiful color properties, resolution and brightness of the screen; *Windows hello recognizes the face fantastically; *Touchscreen and Surface pen allow me to work without the mouse. It also gives me possibility to use papers for doing calculations and making notes: OneNote, Drawboard PDF are beautiful; *Great lifetime: notebook works during up to 13 hours from one charging. For example, by using Wolfram Mathematica, Firefox and LaTeX compiler I've discharged it within 11 hours; *Good performance: although it doesn't allow to play games smoothly (I can't play 2007 Crysis on highest specs), it gives usage of virtual machines, web-browsers with many opened tabs and Photoshop simultaneously without any issues (I use i7 16 Gb version); *Cool design. Be sure that pretty girls will pay attention on Surface Book owner. Although these advantages, this notebook have disadvantages. They are not huge, but makes me feel annoyed sometimes; *Bad coating. Initially matted corpse loses this property even with very accurate usage of notebook (I carry it in the special custom-made (leather, felt) case). *Soft magnesium metal. After taking the notebook in the hand after a significant (not excessive) contraction the bent has appeared on its corpse; *Wheezing left dynamic. This issue appeared, more or less on all Surface devices which I've owhed (SP 3, SP 4, SB); *Oleophobic coating defect. In my experience, among Surface devices this issue is happened only on SB (I've got two units). Precisely, on some part of the screen frame there are areas from which oiled spots from fingers look different and are hard to clean (in compare to "normal" areas); *Program part: even after all Anniversary Update, Intel Beta driver etc I can't make Firefox run as smooth as on old SP 3. Video playing eats many CPU resources (up to 100% for 4k video on YouTube), while on SP3 it eats up to 20%. *Center of mass isn't balanced. The screen part wobbles when I write down text with the stylus.

By Changito from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I got my product about a month ago for school, and found that I have been using it for my everyday life. It has made everything easier and the experience if using this device has been outstanding. Just one thing, it has no video memory which is really sucky because I cant play Xbox games on here.

I thought it would be perfect, but when I got it, I couldn't login in because it already had an account registered. Somehow I managed to pass it with the help of GOOGLE. As I just about to relax and get over with this login problem, my dad told me that he found the battery is dropping like real quick even after several times of full re-charging. AND one last disappointment---the connection of the charger is not always reliable, as it is extremely unstable. After all of this mess, I realized that this product could only be an unsuccessful renovating one. Unlucky for me and my dad,because we paid the for a brand-new Surface Book and instead got an old one. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (6 of 20 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/17/2016 (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful)   1.0 Should have returned it when I had a chance By Rudy1005 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: My first experience was not great. I bought it and had the person at the Microsoft store set it up for me. He noticed there was an issue with it detaching so I had to return it because the screen was not detaching correctly. So no problem they switched it out for me. Then after that I thought I could go home and everything would be fine. Once I got home I tried to use it and the same issue occurred. I could not detach the screen. So I had to drive all the way back to the Microsoft store where I got it switched out again. It worked fine for a little bit then I realized when I detached the screen from the keyboard and reattached it the keyboard would not work so I either would have to attempt to detach it with the onscreen button which seldom worked or I had to completely restart it. The battery life is not what I thought it would be. It lasts much less than I thought. I do really enjoy the responsiveness of the pen and the note taking abilities. However I would not recommend the laptop and given the chance again I would buy one of the surface pros instead because of the cost and simple keyboard that just pops off unlike this annoying issue with disconnecting. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/13/2016 (4 of 7 customers found this review helpful)   5.0 Best laptop I've ever had!! By Itaitheone from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It has been a year of using the Surface Book and i have no complains it is smooth, easy to use, sturdy and it even survived a motorcycle crash unlike the bike itself... although I even fell on the laptop. I love the battery life! I go out in the morning come back late home after working on only battery life it still has enough for me to run some tasks before it will ask me to plug it in. on average I get about 12-14 hours... yes I'm not joking. The pen is good a bit big but I love the fact that I can switch heads for different writing feeling. Resolution is amazing! Keyboard feels like the real deal and the touch pad is almost as functional as the mac one.

It is a great one obviously and I had a lot of fun using it. I had to exchange one. The fact that I chose exchange rather than return shows that I am still confident in this product. The customer service is very nice/ Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (0 of 1 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/12/2016 (2 of 4 customers found this review helpful)   3.0 Wow.... Awe Man... In One Beautiful Device By Claywd from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It started with a Surface pro 4 and after 4 upgrades I ended up settling for the 512GB/i7/dGPU Surface Book. I am 95% happy with the device. Pros: - Fast: really fast. It rivals my Mac Pro which has been heavily upgraded. - Capable: Gaming? YES! AutoCAD? YES! Photoshop? YES! App Development? YES! Note Taking? YES PLEASE! - Seamless: most things are thought through and the device just works. Windows Hello rocks - Stylus: A++ - Thin & and Light: travels everywhere with me. Longboarding, School, Bus, Home Office, whatever. It works everywhere I need it. - Battery Life: Last ALL DAY! I have to work hard to make it die before I get my work done. - Display: Goodnight this display is right on. Photo's, videos, and colors are right on. Cons: - Every trackpad since the MacBook Pro allows for taping the touchpad even when navigating with other fingers simultaneously. Not this one... it's annoying. - No native Linux drivers: I know its a little techy but I have to have Linux and there is no support at this time other than Windows Subsystem for Linux. - Should add a magnetic plate to the top and right sides of the device so you can put your pen anywhere. - Beats, Skullcandy, etc. Headphone controls don't actually control the device. Kicks me out of that mobile tablet mode I get comfortable in when watching movies. - Thunderbolt is missing - USB-C is missing - MicroSD is missing. I've been using for 6 months and I wouldn't trade it for another device. I love it. I could love it more but I wouldn't give it up for anything other than a MacPro coupled with a iPad Pro. I still wouldn't be as happy though.

By Xander999 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I bought this product in April, and have only recently started attempting to use it for full functionality. Microsoft claims it can replace your desktop. This product works fine as a glorified web browser, but when tasked with actual work, like rendering or playing basic video games, it overheats non-stop. Its specifications are good but it cannot operate at anywhere close to the advertised functionality. This is not a good replacement for any of your devices. Microsoft should have stayed in the software business and not gone into hardware. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (1 of 4 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/28/2016   1.0 Poor Qualities By Not happy customer2133121 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: Screen stopped responding to touch. Doesn't wake from sleep. Battery life low. Heats up very very quickly. Oh and again...the screen does not RESPOND. No matter what I do the touch screen does not work even the PC itself says that it should be working fine. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/25/2016 (2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)   4.0 Beautiful in general, problematic in some details By Maksym_Ovchynnikov from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: *Beautiful color properties, resolution and brightness of the screen; *Windows hello recognizes the face fantastically; *Touchscreen and Surface pen allow me to work without the mouse. It also gives me possibility to use papers for doing calculations and making notes: OneNote, Drawboard PDF are beautiful; *Great lifetime: notebook works during up to 13 hours from one charging. For example, by using Wolfram Mathematica, Firefox and LaTeX compiler I've discharged it within 11 hours; *Good performance: although it doesn't allow to play games smoothly (I can't play 2007 Crysis on highest specs), it gives usage of virtual machines, web-browsers with many opened tabs and Photoshop simultaneously without any issues (I use i7 16 Gb version); *Cool design. Be sure that pretty girls will pay attention on Surface Book owner. Although these advantages, this notebook have disadvantages. They are not huge, but makes me feel annoyed sometimes; *Bad coating. Initially matted corpse loses this property even with very accurate usage of notebook (I carry it in the special custom-made (leather, felt) case). *Soft magnesium metal. After taking the notebook in the hand after a significant (not excessive) contraction the bent has appeared on its corpse; *Wheezing left dynamic. This issue appeared, more or less on all Surface devices which I've owhed (SP 3, SP 4, SB); *Oleophobic coating defect. In my experience, among Surface devices this issue is happened only on SB (I've got two units). Precisely, on some part of the screen frame there are areas from which oiled spots from fingers look different and are hard to clean (in compare to "normal" areas); *Program part: even after all Anniversary Update, Intel Beta driver etc I can't make Firefox run as smooth as on old SP 3. Video playing eats many CPU resources (up to 100% for 4k video on YouTube), while on SP3 it eats up to 20%. *Center of mass isn't balanced. The screen part wobbles when I write down text with the stylus.

By Changito from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I got my product about a month ago for school, and found that I have been using it for my everyday life. It has made everything easier and the experience if using this device has been outstanding. Just one thing, it has no video memory which is really sucky because I cant play Xbox games on here.

I thought it would be perfect, but when I got it, I couldn't login in because it already had an account registered. Somehow I managed to pass it with the help of GOOGLE. As I just about to relax and get over with this login problem, my dad told me that he found the battery is dropping like real quick even after several times of full re-charging. AND one last disappointment---the connection of the charger is not always reliable, as it is extremely unstable. After all of this mess, I realized that this product could only be an unsuccessful renovating one. Unlucky for me and my dad,because we paid the for a brand-new Surface Book and instead got an old one. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (6 of 20 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/17/2016 (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful)   1.0 Should have returned it when I had a chance By Rudy1005 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: My first experience was not great. I bought it and had the person at the Microsoft store set it up for me. He noticed there was an issue with it detaching so I had to return it because the screen was not detaching correctly. So no problem they switched it out for me. Then after that I thought I could go home and everything would be fine. Once I got home I tried to use it and the same issue occurred. I could not detach the screen. So I had to drive all the way back to the Microsoft store where I got it switched out again. It worked fine for a little bit then I realized when I detached the screen from the keyboard and reattached it the keyboard would not work so I either would have to attempt to detach it with the onscreen button which seldom worked or I had to completely restart it. The battery life is not what I thought it would be. It lasts much less than I thought. I do really enjoy the responsiveness of the pen and the note taking abilities. However I would not recommend the laptop and given the chance again I would buy one of the surface pros instead because of the cost and simple keyboard that just pops off unlike this annoying issue with disconnecting. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/13/2016 (4 of 7 customers found this review helpful)   5.0 Best laptop I've ever had!! By Itaitheone from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It has been a year of using the Surface Book and i have no complains it is smooth, easy to use, sturdy and it even survived a motorcycle crash unlike the bike itself... although I even fell on the laptop. I love the battery life! I go out in the morning come back late home after working on only battery life it still has enough for me to run some tasks before it will ask me to plug it in. on average I get about 12-14 hours... yes I'm not joking. The pen is good a bit big but I love the fact that I can switch heads for different writing feeling. Resolution is amazing! Keyboard feels like the real deal and the touch pad is almost as functional as the mac one.

It is a great one obviously and I had a lot of fun using it. I had to exchange one. The fact that I chose exchange rather than return shows that I am still confident in this product. The customer service is very nice/ Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (0 of 1 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/12/2016 (2 of 4 customers found this review helpful)   3.0 Wow.... Awe Man... In One Beautiful Device By Claywd from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It started with a Surface pro 4 and after 4 upgrades I ended up settling for the 512GB/i7/dGPU Surface Book. I am 95% happy with the device. Pros: - Fast: really fast. It rivals my Mac Pro which has been heavily upgraded. - Capable: Gaming? YES! AutoCAD? YES! Photoshop? YES! App Development? YES! Note Taking? YES PLEASE! - Seamless: most things are thought through and the device just works. Windows Hello rocks - Stylus: A++ - Thin & and Light: travels everywhere with me. Longboarding, School, Bus, Home Office, whatever. It works everywhere I need it. - Battery Life: Last ALL DAY! I have to work hard to make it die before I get my work done. - Display: Goodnight this display is right on. Photo's, videos, and colors are right on. Cons: - Every trackpad since the MacBook Pro allows for taping the touchpad even when navigating with other fingers simultaneously. Not this one... it's annoying. - No native Linux drivers: I know its a little techy but I have to have Linux and there is no support at this time other than Windows Subsystem for Linux. - Should add a magnetic plate to the top and right sides of the device so you can put your pen anywhere. - Beats, Skullcandy, etc. Headphone controls don't actually control the device. Kicks me out of that mobile tablet mode I get comfortable in when watching movies. - Thunderbolt is missing - USB-C is missing - MicroSD is missing. I've been using for 6 months and I wouldn't trade it for another device. I love it. I could love it more but I wouldn't give it up for anything other than a MacPro coupled with a iPad Pro. I still wouldn't be as happy though.

By Xander999 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I bought this product in April, and have only recently started attempting to use it for full functionality. Microsoft claims it can replace your desktop. This product works fine as a glorified web browser, but when tasked with actual work, like rendering or playing basic video games, it overheats non-stop. Its specifications are good but it cannot operate at anywhere close to the advertised functionality. This is not a good replacement for any of your devices. Microsoft should have stayed in the software business and not gone into hardware.

It also gives me possibility to use papers for doing calculations and making notes: OneNote, Drawboard PDF are beautiful; *Great lifetime: notebook works during up to 13 hours from one charging. For example, by using Wolfram Mathematica, Firefox and LaTeX compiler I've discharged it within 11 hours; *Good performance: although it doesn't allow to play games smoothly (I can't play 2007 Crysis on highest specs), it gives usage of virtual machines, web-browsers with many opened tabs and Photoshop simultaneously without any issues (I use i7 16 Gb version); *Cool design. Be sure that pretty girls will pay attention on Surface Book owner. Although these advantages, this notebook have disadvantages. They are not huge, but makes me feel annoyed sometimes; *Bad coating. Initially matted corpse loses this property even with very accurate usage of notebook (I carry it in the special custom-made (leather, felt) case). *Soft magnesium metal. After taking the notebook in the hand after a significant (not excessive) contraction the bent has appeared on its corpse; *Wheezing left dynamic. This issue appeared, more or less on all Surface devices which I've owhed (SP 3, SP 4, SB); *Oleophobic coating defect. In my experience, among Surface devices this issue is happened only on SB (I've got two units). Precisely, on some part of the screen frame there are areas from which oiled spots from fingers look different and are hard to clean (in compare to "normal" areas); *Program part: even after all Anniversary Update, Intel Beta driver etc I can't make Firefox run as smooth as on old SP 3. Video playing eats many CPU resources (up to 100% for 4k video on YouTube), while on SP3 it eats up to 20%. *Center of mass isn't balanced. The screen part wobbles when I write down text with the stylus.

By Changito from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I got my product about a month ago for school, and found that I have been using it for my everyday life. It has made everything easier and the experience if using this device has been outstanding. Just one thing, it has no video memory which is really sucky because I cant play Xbox games on here.

I thought it would be perfect, but when I got it, I couldn't login in because it already had an account registered. Somehow I managed to pass it with the help of GOOGLE. As I just about to relax and get over with this login problem, my dad told me that he found the battery is dropping like real quick even after several times of full re-charging. AND one last disappointment---the connection of the charger is not always reliable, as it is extremely unstable. After all of this mess, I realized that this product could only be an unsuccessful renovating one. Unlucky for me and my dad,because we paid the for a brand-new Surface Book and instead got an old one. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (6 of 20 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/17/2016 (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful)   1.0 Should have returned it when I had a chance By Rudy1005 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: My first experience was not great. I bought it and had the person at the Microsoft store set it up for me. He noticed there was an issue with it detaching so I had to return it because the screen was not detaching correctly. So no problem they switched it out for me. Then after that I thought I could go home and everything would be fine. Once I got home I tried to use it and the same issue occurred. I could not detach the screen. So I had to drive all the way back to the Microsoft store where I got it switched out again. It worked fine for a little bit then I realized when I detached the screen from the keyboard and reattached it the keyboard would not work so I either would have to attempt to detach it with the onscreen button which seldom worked or I had to completely restart it. The battery life is not what I thought it would be. It lasts much less than I thought. I do really enjoy the responsiveness of the pen and the note taking abilities. However I would not recommend the laptop and given the chance again I would buy one of the surface pros instead because of the cost and simple keyboard that just pops off unlike this annoying issue with disconnecting. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/13/2016 (4 of 7 customers found this review helpful)   5.0 Best laptop I've ever had!! By Itaitheone from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It has been a year of using the Surface Book and i have no complains it is smooth, easy to use, sturdy and it even survived a motorcycle crash unlike the bike itself... although I even fell on the laptop. I love the battery life! I go out in the morning come back late home after working on only battery life it still has enough for me to run some tasks before it will ask me to plug it in. on average I get about 12-14 hours... yes I'm not joking. The pen is good a bit big but I love the fact that I can switch heads for different writing feeling. Resolution is amazing! Keyboard feels like the real deal and the touch pad is almost as functional as the mac one.

It is a great one obviously and I had a lot of fun using it. I had to exchange one. The fact that I chose exchange rather than return shows that I am still confident in this product.

Awe Man... In One Beautiful Device By Claywd from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It started with a Surface pro 4 and after 4 upgrades I ended up settling for the 512GB/i7/dGPU Surface Book. I am 95% happy with the device. Pros: - Fast: really fast. It rivals my Mac Pro which has been heavily upgraded. - Capable: Gaming? YES! AutoCAD? YES! Photoshop? YES! App Development? YES! Note Taking? YES PLEASE! - Seamless: most things are thought through and the device just works. Windows Hello rocks - Stylus: A++ - Thin & and Light: travels everywhere with me. Longboarding, School, Bus, Home Office, whatever. It works everywhere I need it. - Battery Life: Last ALL DAY! I have to work hard to make it die before I get my work done. - Display: Goodnight this display is right on. Photo's, videos, and colors are right on. Cons: - Every trackpad since the MacBook Pro allows for taping the touchpad even when navigating with other fingers simultaneously. Not this one... it's annoying. - No native Linux drivers: I know its a little techy but I have to have Linux and there is no support at this time other than Windows Subsystem for Linux. - Should add a magnetic plate to the top and right sides of the device so you can put your pen anywhere. - Beats, Skullcandy, etc. Headphone controls don't actually control the device. Kicks me out of that mobile tablet mode I get comfortable in when watching movies. - Thunderbolt is missing - USB-C is missing - MicroSD is missing. I've been using for 6 months and I wouldn't trade it for another device. I love it. I could love it more but I wouldn't give it up for anything other than a MacPro coupled with a iPad Pro. I still wouldn't be as happy though.

Be sure that pretty girls will pay attention on Surface Book owner. Although these advantages, this notebook have disadvantages. They are not huge, but makes me feel annoyed sometimes; *Bad coating. Initially matted corpse loses this property even with very accurate usage of notebook (I carry it in the special custom-made (leather, felt) case). *Soft magnesium metal. After taking the notebook in the hand after a significant (not excessive) contraction the bent has appeared on its corpse; *Wheezing left dynamic. This issue appeared, more or less on all Surface devices which I've owhed (SP 3, SP 4, SB); *Oleophobic coating defect. In my experience, among Surface devices this issue is happened only on SB (I've got two units). Precisely, on some part of the screen frame there are areas from which oiled spots from fingers look different and are hard to clean (in compare to "normal" areas); *Program part: even after all Anniversary Update, Intel Beta driver etc I can't make Firefox run as smooth as on old SP 3. Video playing eats many CPU resources (up to 100% for 4k video on YouTube), while on SP3 it eats up to 20%. *Center of mass isn't balanced.

I thought it would be perfect, but when I got it, I couldn't login in because it already had an account registered. Somehow I managed to pass it with the help of GOOGLE. As I just about to relax and get over with this login problem, my dad told me that he found the battery is dropping like real quick even after several times of full re-charging. AND one last disappointment---the connection of the charger is not always reliable, as it is extremely unstable. After all of this mess, I realized that this product could only be an unsuccessful renovating one.

I bought it and had the person at the Microsoft store set it up for me. He noticed there was an issue with it detaching so I had to return it because the screen was not detaching correctly. So no problem they switched it out for me. Then after that I thought I could go home and everything would be fine. Once I got home I tried to use it and the same issue occurred. I could not detach the screen. So I had to drive all the way back to the Microsoft store where I got it switched out again. It worked fine for a little bit then I realized when I detached the screen from the keyboard and reattached it the keyboard would not work so I either would have to attempt to detach it with the onscreen button which seldom worked or I had to completely restart it. The battery life is not what I thought it would be. It lasts much less than I thought. I do really enjoy the responsiveness of the pen and the note taking abilities. However I would not recommend the laptop and given the chance again I would buy one of the surface pros instead because of the cost and simple keyboard that just pops off unlike this annoying issue with disconnecting.

By Itaitheone from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It has been a year of using the Surface Book and i have no complains it is smooth, easy to use, sturdy and it even survived a motorcycle crash unlike the bike itself... although I even fell on the laptop. I love the battery life! I go out in the morning come back late home after working on only battery life it still has enough for me to run some tasks before it will ask me to plug it in. on average I get about 12-14 hours... yes I'm not joking. The pen is good a bit big but I love the fact that I can switch heads for different writing feeling. Resolution is amazing! Keyboard feels like the real deal and the touch pad is almost as functional as the mac one.

Awe Man... In One Beautiful Device By Claywd from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It started with a Surface pro 4 and after 4 upgrades I ended up settling for the 512GB/i7/dGPU Surface Book. I am 95% happy with the device. Pros: - Fast: really fast. It rivals my Mac Pro which has been heavily upgraded. - Capable: Gaming? YES! AutoCAD? YES! Photoshop? YES! App Development? YES! Note Taking? YES PLEASE! - Seamless: most things are thought through and the device just works. Windows Hello rocks - Stylus: A++ - Thin & and Light: travels everywhere with me. Longboarding, School, Bus, Home Office, whatever. It works everywhere I need it. - Battery Life: Last ALL DAY! I have to work hard to make it die before I get my work done. - Display: Goodnight this display is right on. Photo's, videos, and colors are right on. Cons: - Every trackpad since the MacBook Pro allows for taping the touchpad even when navigating with other fingers simultaneously. Not this one... it's annoying. - No native Linux drivers: I know its a little techy but I have to have Linux and there is no support at this time other than Windows Subsystem for Linux. - Should add a magnetic plate to the top and right sides of the device so you can put your pen anywhere. - Beats, Skullcandy, etc. Headphone controls don't actually control the device. Kicks me out of that mobile tablet mode I get comfortable in when watching movies. - Thunderbolt is missing - USB-C is missing - MicroSD is missing. I've been using for 6 months and I wouldn't trade it for another device. I love it. I could love it more but I wouldn't give it up for anything other than a MacPro coupled with a iPad Pro. I still wouldn't be as happy though.

By Xander999 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I bought this product in April, and have only recently started attempting to use it for full functionality. Microsoft claims it can replace your desktop. This product works fine as a glorified web browser, but when tasked with actual work, like rendering or playing basic video games, it overheats non-stop. Its specifications are good but it cannot operate at anywhere close to the advertised functionality. This is not a good replacement for any of your devices. Microsoft should have stayed in the software business and not gone into hardware.

For example, by using Wolfram Mathematica, Firefox and LaTeX compiler I've discharged it within 11 hours; *Good performance: although it doesn't allow to play games smoothly (I can't play 2007 Crysis on highest specs), it gives usage of virtual machines, web-browsers with many opened tabs and Photoshop simultaneously without any issues (I use i7 16 Gb version); *Cool design. Be sure that pretty girls will pay attention on Surface Book owner. Although these advantages, this notebook have disadvantages. They are not huge, but makes me feel annoyed sometimes; *Bad coating. Initially matted corpse loses this property even with very accurate usage of notebook (I carry it in the special custom-made (leather, felt) case). *Soft magnesium metal. After taking the notebook in the hand after a significant (not excessive) contraction the bent has appeared on its corpse; *Wheezing left dynamic. This issue appeared, more or less on all Surface devices which I've owhed (SP 3, SP 4, SB); *Oleophobic coating defect. In my experience, among Surface devices this issue is happened only on SB (I've got two units).

9/17/2016 (8 of 15 customers found this review helpful)   1.0 Should have returned it when I had a chance By Rudy1005 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: My first experience was not great. I bought it and had the person at the Microsoft store set it up for me. He noticed there was an issue with it detaching so I had to return it because the screen was not detaching correctly. So no problem they switched it out for me. Then after that I thought I could go home and everything would be fine. Once I got home I tried to use it and the same issue occurred. I could not detach the screen. So I had to drive all the way back to the Microsoft store where I got it switched out again. It worked fine for a little bit then I realized when I detached the screen from the keyboard and reattached it the keyboard would not work so I either would have to attempt to detach it with the onscreen button which seldom worked or I had to completely restart it. The battery life is not what I thought it would be. It lasts much less than I thought. I do really enjoy the responsiveness of the pen and the note taking abilities. However I would not recommend the laptop and given the chance again I would buy one of the surface pros instead because of the cost and simple keyboard that just pops off unlike this annoying issue with disconnecting.

By Itaitheone from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It has been a year of using the Surface Book and i have no complains it is smooth, easy to use, sturdy and it even survived a motorcycle crash unlike the bike itself... although I even fell on the laptop. I love the battery life! I go out in the morning come back late home after working on only battery life it still has enough for me to run some tasks before it will ask me to plug it in. on average I get about 12-14 hours... yes I'm not joking. The pen is good a bit big but I love the fact that I can switch heads for different writing feeling. Resolution is amazing! Keyboard feels like the real deal and the touch pad is almost as functional as the mac one.

9/12/2016 (2 of 4 customers found this review helpful)   3.0 Wow.... Awe Man... In One Beautiful Device By Claywd from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: It started with a Surface pro 4 and after 4 upgrades I ended up settling for the 512GB/i7/dGPU Surface Book. I am 95% happy with the device. Pros: - Fast: really fast. It rivals my Mac Pro which has been heavily upgraded. - Capable: Gaming? YES! AutoCAD? YES! Photoshop? YES! App Development? YES! Note Taking? YES PLEASE! - Seamless: most things are thought through and the device just works. Windows Hello rocks - Stylus: A++ - Thin & and Light: travels everywhere with me. Longboarding, School, Bus, Home Office, whatever. It works everywhere I need it. - Battery Life: Last ALL DAY! I have to work hard to make it die before I get my work done. - Display: Goodnight this display is right on. Photo's, videos, and colors are right on. Cons: - Every trackpad since the MacBook Pro allows for taping the touchpad even when navigating with other fingers simultaneously. Not this one... it's annoying. - No native Linux drivers: I know its a little techy but I have to have Linux and there is no support at this time other than Windows Subsystem for Linux. - Should add a magnetic plate to the top and right sides of the device so you can put your pen anywhere. - Beats, Skullcandy, etc. Headphone controls don't actually control the device. Kicks me out of that mobile tablet mode I get comfortable in when watching movies. - Thunderbolt is missing - USB-C is missing - MicroSD is missing. I've been using for 6 months and I wouldn't trade it for another device. I love it. I could love it more but I wouldn't give it up for anything other than a MacPro coupled with a iPad Pro. I still wouldn't be as happy though.
