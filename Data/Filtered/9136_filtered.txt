I took 2 stars off for Lenovo not including a HD connector in SSD only models ... Pro: Bang for the buck, very good base hardware, especially fast 128G, PCIe NVMe enabled SSD containing the OS, and 16G DDR4 RAM, good looking design with effective ventilation system, latest Intel Skylake quad core i7 processor, Intel's best thus far integrated GPU HD 530 for when not gaming, nice aluminum exterior, the audio sound is pretty good ... Con: turtle speed 5,400 rpm 1TB HD - once you've gone SSD, you cannot go back to traditional HD ... I must have about 20 OEM HDs that I pulled, in my cabinet drawer serving as restore/ backup disks, in case a SSD crash and burns ... aluminum exterior is a major finger print magnet, LCD looks bit fuzzy with the non glare cover, I may strip it off soon ... Also, lots of Lenovo bloatware; I didn't chuck all of them but did delete good many of them, as well as bunch of microsoft junkware ... terrible battery life but it's expected with quad core processor and a puny battery ... Upgraded 1TB HD to 1TB SSD and 16G RAM to 32G. I can multi-task like nobody's business and never run out of memory ... not yet anyway ... games don't really run any faster ... I have both 14 and 15 inch Y700 ... I like the 15 in. model better overall ... better graphics card, marginally better audio sound, only slightly more expensive ... Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by ubersoldat13 from Y700 15 in review This is in regards to the 80NV005NUS model Aesthetics: Personally, I love the color combo of Black and Red. It's very slim for a rig of this power, and feels extremely solid while being extremely heavy. On a side note, I would've preferred a physical border around the screen rather than just being glass. Fingerprints and all. But that's a more minor issue. The texture on the laptop feels nice too. Simply put, I love it. Hardware: Keyboard is nice, cooling system works well, touchpad is responsive and smooth, The screen is wonderful. But...something to be warned about: The description says it comes with a 128 GB SSD. In actuality, it's only about 90 GB, and Windows takes up about half of that. So, Something to be careful about that. (Though, with Windows on the SSD, the computer boots up in 8 seconds.) Performance: This. Thing. Is. A. Beast. Every game I've played runs at a solid 50-60 FPS on high to max settings. (With the exception of Company of Heroes 2, but that's just such an intensive game. Even still, on high settings that manages 40-50 FPS.) Check the pictures below. I should also mention, that I did have to tone down the anti-aliasing a bit on some games (On War Thunder, using FXAA High takes the FPS from 70 down to 30.) But If you're moving from an old computer not meant to run gams to this? It's nothing short of miraculous. The sound is also really nice, though the JBL speakers, though not as much bass as I would have liked. Though, For some reason, if left alone for an unknown (long) period of time, the computer will shut itself off instead of staying asleep. Not too big a problem, since I stated before that it boots in less than 10 seconds, but it's a mild nuisance. Also, when quitting some games, a message pops up saying that the "Full Screen driver" has crashed or something. Haven't noticed anything bad about that, but I'd thought I'd mention it. Software* (Note that most of this is most likely not the fault of the PC, but the software itself): Most of it works fine, but there are some issues: The Bluetooth keeps getting errors and keeps shutting itself off. (requiring the gargantuan effort of...putting the computer to sleep and waking it back up.) My (bluetooth) mouse was also lagging a lot the first day, but that's a Windows 10 problem. (It's since been solved) It also has a nasty habit of suddenly Alt-tabbing out of games, particularly in War Thunder. Also, the NVidia Experience thing doesn't "connect" upon initially running it and requires a bit of a delve into the files. Shipping: Entire process from buying to having it in my hands took about a week and a half. Very impressed. Summary/Conclusion: This is an amazing PC for the money. Once you fix all the problems with the software not working (Because, y'know, Windows), this thing runs like a dream. I'm not regretting this purchase one bit. Date published: 2015-11-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alekane14 from By far one of the best PC's I have ever had... The Y700 is advertised as a gaming laptop. While this is true, it is capable of so much more. In my time using this laptop, there has yet to be a game that doesn't run on ultra settings. From Battlefield 3 to Wolfenstein The Old Blood, this laptop does it all. Also, it's rendering capabilities for editing video is truly astounding as well. So, whether you plan on buying this laptop for gaming or for editing, it will most certainly exceed your expectations. Pros: - The processor - The graphics card - The keyboard - Touchpad - Cooling system - Low fan noise Cons: - Heavier than most laptops - Lack of a mute button Date published: 2015-12-03 Y700-15ISK Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:17CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_178 loc_en_US, sid_77AF53D2D02ECA750F03775C537292A8_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo Should I get this laptop now, or is there a newer model coming out soon.

I took 2 stars off for Lenovo not including a HD connector in SSD only models ... Pro: Bang for the buck, very good base hardware, especially fast 128G, PCIe NVMe enabled SSD containing the OS, and 16G DDR4 RAM, good looking design with effective ventilation system, latest Intel Skylake quad core i7 processor, Intel's best thus far integrated GPU HD 530 for when not gaming, nice aluminum exterior, the audio sound is pretty good ... Con: turtle speed 5,400 rpm 1TB HD - once you've gone SSD, you cannot go back to traditional HD ... I must have about 20 OEM HDs that I pulled, in my cabinet drawer serving as restore/ backup disks, in case a SSD crash and burns ... aluminum exterior is a major finger print magnet, LCD looks bit fuzzy with the non glare cover, I may strip it off soon ... Also, lots of Lenovo bloatware; I didn't chuck all of them but did delete good many of them, as well as bunch of microsoft junkware ... terrible battery life but it's expected with quad core processor and a puny battery ... Upgraded 1TB HD to 1TB SSD and 16G RAM to 32G. I can multi-task like nobody's business and never run out of memory ... not yet anyway ... games don't really run any faster ... I have both 14 and 15 inch Y700 ... I like the 15 in. model better overall ... better graphics card, marginally better audio sound, only slightly more expensive ... Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by ubersoldat13 from Y700 15 in review This is in regards to the 80NV005NUS model Aesthetics: Personally, I love the color combo of Black and Red. It's very slim for a rig of this power, and feels extremely solid while being extremely heavy. On a side note, I would've preferred a physical border around the screen rather than just being glass. Fingerprints and all. But that's a more minor issue. The texture on the laptop feels nice too. Simply put, I love it. Hardware: Keyboard is nice, cooling system works well, touchpad is responsive and smooth, The screen is wonderful. But...something to be warned about: The description says it comes with a 128 GB SSD. In actuality, it's only about 90 GB, and Windows takes up about half of that. So, Something to be careful about that. (Though, with Windows on the SSD, the computer boots up in 8 seconds.) Performance: This. Thing. Is. A. Beast. Every game I've played runs at a solid 50-60 FPS on high to max settings. (With the exception of Company of Heroes 2, but that's just such an intensive game. Even still, on high settings that manages 40-50 FPS.) Check the pictures below. I should also mention, that I did have to tone down the anti-aliasing a bit on some games (On War Thunder, using FXAA High takes the FPS from 70 down to 30.) But If you're moving from an old computer not meant to run gams to this? It's nothing short of miraculous. The sound is also really nice, though the JBL speakers, though not as much bass as I would have liked. Though, For some reason, if left alone for an unknown (long) period of time, the computer will shut itself off instead of staying asleep. Not too big a problem, since I stated before that it boots in less than 10 seconds, but it's a mild nuisance. Also, when quitting some games, a message pops up saying that the "Full Screen driver" has crashed or something. Haven't noticed anything bad about that, but I'd thought I'd mention it. Software* (Note that most of this is most likely not the fault of the PC, but the software itself): Most of it works fine, but there are some issues: The Bluetooth keeps getting errors and keeps shutting itself off. (requiring the gargantuan effort of...putting the computer to sleep and waking it back up.) My (bluetooth) mouse was also lagging a lot the first day, but that's a Windows 10 problem. (It's since been solved) It also has a nasty habit of suddenly Alt-tabbing out of games, particularly in War Thunder. Also, the NVidia Experience thing doesn't "connect" upon initially running it and requires a bit of a delve into the files. Shipping: Entire process from buying to having it in my hands took about a week and a half. Very impressed. Summary/Conclusion: This is an amazing PC for the money. Once you fix all the problems with the software not working (Because, y'know, Windows), this thing runs like a dream. I'm not regretting this purchase one bit. Date published: 2015-11-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alekane14 from By far one of the best PC's I have ever had... The Y700 is advertised as a gaming laptop. While this is true, it is capable of so much more. In my time using this laptop, there has yet to be a game that doesn't run on ultra settings. From Battlefield 3 to Wolfenstein The Old Blood, this laptop does it all. Also, it's rendering capabilities for editing video is truly astounding as well. So, whether you plan on buying this laptop for gaming or for editing, it will most certainly exceed your expectations. Pros: - The processor - The graphics card - The keyboard - Touchpad - Cooling system - Low fan noise Cons: - Heavier than most laptops - Lack of a mute button Date published: 2015-12-03 Y700-15ISK Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:17CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_178 loc_en_US, sid_77AF53D2D02ECA750F03775C537292A8_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo Should I get this laptop now, or is there a newer model coming out soon.

Rated 3 out of 5 by zanypoet from Quad Core i7, 32G RAM, 4G GDDR5 ... I took 2 stars off for Lenovo not including a HD connector in SSD only models ... Pro: Bang for the buck, very good base hardware, especially fast 128G, PCIe NVMe enabled SSD containing the OS, and 16G DDR4 RAM, good looking design with effective ventilation system, latest Intel Skylake quad core i7 processor, Intel's best thus far integrated GPU HD 530 for when not gaming, nice aluminum exterior, the audio sound is pretty good ... Con: turtle speed 5,400 rpm 1TB HD - once you've gone SSD, you cannot go back to traditional HD ... I must have about 20 OEM HDs that I pulled, in my cabinet drawer serving as restore/ backup disks, in case a SSD crash and burns ... aluminum exterior is a major finger print magnet, LCD looks bit fuzzy with the non glare cover, I may strip it off soon ... Also, lots of Lenovo bloatware; I didn't chuck all of them but did delete good many of them, as well as bunch of microsoft junkware ... terrible battery life but it's expected with quad core processor and a puny battery ... Upgraded 1TB HD to 1TB SSD and 16G RAM to 32G. I can multi-task like nobody's business and never run out of memory ... not yet anyway ... games don't really run any faster ... I have both 14 and 15 inch Y700 ... I like the 15 in. model better overall ... better graphics card, marginally better audio sound, only slightly more expensive ... Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by ubersoldat13 from Y700 15 in review This is in regards to the 80NV005NUS model Aesthetics: Personally, I love the color combo of Black and Red. It's very slim for a rig of this power, and feels extremely solid while being extremely heavy. On a side note, I would've preferred a physical border around the screen rather than just being glass. Fingerprints and all. But that's a more minor issue. The texture on the laptop feels nice too. Simply put, I love it. Hardware: Keyboard is nice, cooling system works well, touchpad is responsive and smooth, The screen is wonderful. But...something to be warned about: The description says it comes with a 128 GB SSD. In actuality, it's only about 90 GB, and Windows takes up about half of that. So, Something to be careful about that. (Though, with Windows on the SSD, the computer boots up in 8 seconds.) Performance: This. Thing. Is. A. Beast. Every game I've played runs at a solid 50-60 FPS on high to max settings. (With the exception of Company of Heroes 2, but that's just such an intensive game. Even still, on high settings that manages 40-50 FPS.) Check the pictures below. I should also mention, that I did have to tone down the anti-aliasing a bit on some games (On War Thunder, using FXAA High takes the FPS from 70 down to 30.) But If you're moving from an old computer not meant to run gams to this? It's nothing short of miraculous. The sound is also really nice, though the JBL speakers, though not as much bass as I would have liked. Though, For some reason, if left alone for an unknown (long) period of time, the computer will shut itself off instead of staying asleep. Not too big a problem, since I stated before that it boots in less than 10 seconds, but it's a mild nuisance. Also, when quitting some games, a message pops up saying that the "Full Screen driver" has crashed or something. Haven't noticed anything bad about that, but I'd thought I'd mention it. Software* (Note that most of this is most likely not the fault of the PC, but the software itself): Most of it works fine, but there are some issues: The Bluetooth keeps getting errors and keeps shutting itself off. (requiring the gargantuan effort of...putting the computer to sleep and waking it back up.) My (bluetooth) mouse was also lagging a lot the first day, but that's a Windows 10 problem. (It's since been solved) It also has a nasty habit of suddenly Alt-tabbing out of games, particularly in War Thunder. Also, the NVidia Experience thing doesn't "connect" upon initially running it and requires a bit of a delve into the files. Shipping: Entire process from buying to having it in my hands took about a week and a half. Very impressed. Summary/Conclusion: This is an amazing PC for the money. Once you fix all the problems with the software not working (Because, y'know, Windows), this thing runs like a dream. I'm not regretting this purchase one bit. Date published: 2015-11-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alekane14 from By far one of the best PC's I have ever had... The Y700 is advertised as a gaming laptop. While this is true, it is capable of so much more. In my time using this laptop, there has yet to be a game that doesn't run on ultra settings. From Battlefield 3 to Wolfenstein The Old Blood, this laptop does it all. Also, it's rendering capabilities for editing video is truly astounding as well. So, whether you plan on buying this laptop for gaming or for editing, it will most certainly exceed your expectations. Pros: - The processor - The graphics card - The keyboard - Touchpad - Cooling system - Low fan noise Cons: - Heavier than most laptops - Lack of a mute button Date published: 2015-12-03 Y700-15ISK Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:17CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_178 loc_en_US, sid_77AF53D2D02ECA750F03775C537292A8_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo

Shipping: Entire process from buying to having it in my hands took about a week and a half. Very impressed. Summary/Conclusion: This is an amazing PC for the money. Once you fix all the problems with the software not working (Because, y'know, Windows), this thing runs like a dream. I'm not regretting this purchase one bit. Date published: 2015-11-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alekane14 from By far one of the best PC's I have ever had... The Y700 is advertised as a gaming laptop. While this is true, it is capable of so much more. In my time using this laptop, there has yet to be a game that doesn't run on ultra settings. From Battlefield 3 to Wolfenstein The Old Blood, this laptop does it all. Also, it's rendering capabilities for editing video is truly astounding as well. So, whether you plan on buying this laptop for gaming or for editing, it will most certainly exceed your expectations.

Rated 3 out of 5 by zanypoet from Quad Core i7, 32G RAM, 4G GDDR5 ... I took 2 stars off for Lenovo not including a HD connector in SSD only models ... Pro: Bang for the buck, very good base hardware, especially fast 128G, PCIe NVMe enabled SSD containing the OS, and 16G DDR4 RAM, good looking design with effective ventilation system, latest Intel Skylake quad core i7 processor, Intel's best thus far integrated GPU HD 530 for when not gaming, nice aluminum exterior, the audio sound is pretty good ... Con: turtle speed 5,400 rpm 1TB HD - once you've gone SSD, you cannot go back to traditional HD ... I must have about 20 OEM HDs that I pulled, in my cabinet drawer serving as restore/ backup disks, in case a SSD crash and burns ... aluminum exterior is a major finger print magnet, LCD looks bit fuzzy with the non glare cover, I may strip it off soon ... Also, lots of Lenovo bloatware; I didn't chuck all of them but did delete good many of them, as well as bunch of microsoft junkware ... terrible battery life but it's expected with quad core processor and a puny battery ... Upgraded 1TB HD to 1TB SSD and 16G RAM to 32G. I can multi-task like nobody's business and never run out of memory ... not yet anyway ... games don't really run any faster ... I have both 14 and 15 inch Y700 ... I like the 15 in. model better overall ... better graphics card, marginally better audio sound, only slightly more expensive ... Date published: 2016-08-17

Rated 5 out of 5 by ubersoldat13 from Y700 15 in review This is in regards to the 80NV005NUS model Aesthetics: Personally, I love the color combo of Black and Red. It's very slim for a rig of this power, and feels extremely solid while being extremely heavy. On a side note, I would've preferred a physical border around the screen rather than just being glass. Fingerprints and all. But that's a more minor issue. The texture on the laptop feels nice too. Simply put, I love it. Hardware: Keyboard is nice, cooling system works well, touchpad is responsive and smooth, The screen is wonderful. But...something to be warned about: The description says it comes with a 128 GB SSD. In actuality, it's only about 90 GB, and Windows takes up about half of that. So, Something to be careful about that. (Though, with Windows on the SSD, the computer boots up in 8 seconds.) Performance: This. Thing. Is. A. Beast. Every game I've played runs at a solid 50-60 FPS on high to max settings. (With the exception of Company of Heroes 2, but that's just such an intensive game. Even still, on high settings that manages 40-50 FPS.) Check the pictures below. I should also mention, that I did have to tone down the anti-aliasing a bit on some games (On War Thunder, using FXAA High takes the FPS from 70 down to 30.) But If you're moving from an old computer not meant to run gams to this? It's nothing short of miraculous. The sound is also really nice, though the JBL speakers, though not as much bass as I would have liked. Though, For some reason, if left alone for an unknown (long) period of time, the computer will shut itself off instead of staying asleep. Not too big a problem, since I stated before that it boots in less than 10 seconds, but it's a mild nuisance. Also, when quitting some games, a message pops up saying that the "Full Screen driver" has crashed or something. Haven't noticed anything bad about that, but I'd thought I'd mention it. Software* (Note that most of this is most likely not the fault of the PC, but the software itself): Most of it works fine, but there are some issues: The Bluetooth keeps getting errors and keeps shutting itself off. (requiring the gargantuan effort of...putting the computer to sleep and waking it back up.) My (bluetooth) mouse was also lagging a lot the first day, but that's a Windows 10 problem. (It's since been solved) It also has a nasty habit of suddenly Alt-tabbing out of games, particularly in War Thunder.
