Like the large screen. Overall very pleasant to use. No worries about antivirus software. The Chromebook is far superior to a PC for my purposes. I did my homework and it paid off. Bad Points? Having problems connecting to my Kodak printer. May have to purchase a cloud ready printer. The cheapest is about £40.

Denis Lancaster General home user Good Points+ Very fast by comparison with a PC. Like the large screen. Overall very pleasant to use. No worries about antivirus software. The Chromebook is far superior to a PC for my purposes. I did my homework and it paid off. Bad Points? Having problems connecting to my Kodak printer. May have to purchase a cloud ready printer. The cheapest is about £40. The screen resolution could be better but for this price I should not really complain. All scores from this user: Was this review helpful?
