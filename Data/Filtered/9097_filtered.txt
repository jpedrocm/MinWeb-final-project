For my daily use, it works well. It replaces my former T420. Compared to T420, this machine is much lighter and thinner. (For me, weight matters while thinness is not so important.) Lenovo is reforming the touchpad. It took me some time to find the speakers since they are at the bottom. Personally, I think their performance is decent (better than T420). The network interface disappears because of the thinness. The battery can work for more than 5 hours while the wifi is on. The most exciting thing is that Lenovo has provided thinkpad with high-resolution screens. The 2560*1440 screen is great! Date published: 2016-06-27 Rated 2 out of 5 by MCYC from Poor Build Quality / Quality Control - LCD Hinge Just opened the box and noticed a glaring defect. Appalling lack of quality control in the manufacture of this computer! When laptop is closed, the right edge of the upper lid protrudes over the lower half, while the left edge is shifted in. Disappointed about the poor quality. Expected way more. Beware! Date published: 2016-09-23 Rated 3 out of 5 by Blue Badge from In general I love it - but quality issue In general I really love this Thinkpad. However I just got it 1 week ago and I already have to bring it to a local lenovo service shop because the G Key constantly comes off and the H key soon follows. The Key and its parts are fine in general its seems to me like a manufacturing issue that they dont stay in place. For such a premium price I expect a higher quality and better QA. I hope I get this fixed soon probably the whole keyboard needs to be exchanged. Apart from that I really like the laptop a lot its lightweight and with the PCI-E SSD lightning fast. Its a shame that this quality issue leaves a bitter taste.

For my daily use, it works well. It replaces my former T420. Compared to T420, this machine is much lighter and thinner. (For me, weight matters while thinness is not so important.) Lenovo is reforming the touchpad. It took me some time to find the speakers since they are at the bottom. Personally, I think their performance is decent (better than T420). The network interface disappears because of the thinness. The battery can work for more than 5 hours while the wifi is on. The most exciting thing is that Lenovo has provided thinkpad with high-resolution screens. The 2560*1440 screen is great! Date published: 2016-06-27 Rated 2 out of 5 by MCYC from Poor Build Quality / Quality Control - LCD Hinge Just opened the box and noticed a glaring defect. Appalling lack of quality control in the manufacture of this computer! When laptop is closed, the right edge of the upper lid protrudes over the lower half, while the left edge is shifted in. Disappointed about the poor quality. Expected way more. Beware! Date published: 2016-09-23 Rated 3 out of 5 by Blue Badge from In general I love it - but quality issue In general I really love this Thinkpad. However I just got it 1 week ago and I already have to bring it to a local lenovo service shop because the G Key constantly comes off and the H key soon follows. The Key and its parts are fine in general its seems to me like a manufacturing issue that they dont stay in place. For such a premium price I expect a higher quality and better QA. I hope I get this fixed soon probably the whole keyboard needs to be exchanged. Apart from that I really like the laptop a lot its lightweight and with the PCI-E SSD lightning fast. Its a shame that this quality issue leaves a bitter taste.

Will I need a USB headset/mike? Asked by: trentriverman The X1 Carbon has a built in 720P camera with microphone in the 4th generation laptops.. Recently purchased one and used verbal search (Windows 10 Edge browser) on the internet to look up stuff and tested the speech to type recognition program out(using notepad). It needs training. A USB headset/mic might improve speech recognition capabilities. Answered by: billm1947 Date published: 2016-09-01 Does the ThinkPad X1 Carbon have an available riser? (So that I can attach one external screen and use the laptop as the 2nd screen - and have it at the same height) Asked by: Lynda LL Hello that is not available you will have to search for a laptop stand Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-21 No LAN port?

Rated 5 out of 5 by SurFace from Nice machine I have used this laptop for a month. For my daily use, it works well. It replaces my former T420. Compared to T420, this machine is much lighter and thinner. (For me, weight matters while thinness is not so important.) Lenovo is reforming the touchpad. It took me some time to find the speakers since they are at the bottom. Personally, I think their performance is decent (better than T420). The network interface disappears because of the thinness. The battery can work for more than 5 hours while the wifi is on. The most exciting thing is that Lenovo has provided thinkpad with high-resolution screens. The 2560*1440 screen is great! Date published: 2016-06-27 Rated 2 out of 5 by MCYC from Poor Build Quality / Quality Control - LCD Hinge Just opened the box and noticed a glaring defect. Appalling lack of quality control in the manufacture of this computer! When laptop is closed, the right edge of the upper lid protrudes over the lower half, while the left edge is shifted in. Disappointed about the poor quality. Expected way more. Beware! Date published: 2016-09-23 Rated 3 out of 5 by Blue Badge from In general I love it - but quality issue In general I really love this Thinkpad. However I just got it 1 week ago and I already have to bring it to a local lenovo service shop because the G Key constantly comes off and the H key soon follows. The Key and its parts are fine in general its seems to me like a manufacturing issue that they dont stay in place. For such a premium price I expect a higher quality and better QA. I hope I get this fixed soon probably the whole keyboard needs to be exchanged. Apart from that I really like the laptop a lot its lightweight and with the PCI-E SSD lightning fast. Its a shame that this quality issue leaves a bitter taste.

I need a headset plus microphone for and online course. Will I need a USB headset/mike? Asked by: trentriverman The X1 Carbon has a built in 720P camera with microphone in the 4th generation laptops.. Recently purchased one and used verbal search (Windows 10 Edge browser) on the internet to look up stuff and tested the speech to type recognition program out(using notepad). It needs training. A USB headset/mic might improve speech recognition capabilities. Answered by: billm1947 Date published: 2016-09-01 Does the ThinkPad X1 Carbon have an available riser?
