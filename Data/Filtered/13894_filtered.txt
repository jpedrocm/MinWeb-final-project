Plus, with low weight, thin profile and vibrant color options, the Switch 10 E is the perfect digital companion for your on-the-go lifestyle. Powerful Producer An Intel Atom Z3735F processor offers improved graphics and gaming performance plus impressive power efficiency. This 2-in-1 runs on Windows 10 and features Continuum, which automatically switches the user interface from tablet mode to laptop mode. Versatile Shape-Shifter This device’s perfectly designed Acer Snap Hinge 2 lets you snap the keyboard part on or off with a simple push or pull. Switch effortlessly between four very useful modes: notebook, tablet, tent, and display. Data Protector Acer SwitchLock lets you lock the keyboard dock’s HDD (optional, depending on model) so it only works with the tablet part. Use the tablet as the HDD’s key – simply snap the tablet off the keyboard to lock the HDD. All your HDD data is now protected and can’t be stolen. Simply snap the tablet back on to unlock all that data. Great Entertainer The HD screen features IPS technology2, so you get clear images when viewing from any angle. The screen is also made of ultra-tough Gorilla Glass, which protects against scratches and also makes scratches less visible. Dual speakers deliver serious sound and work with dual cameras to ensure great video calls. Friend of Your Eyes This device features Acer VisionCare, so you can switch on Acer BluelightShield to reduce stress-causing blue light when you need to look at the screen for long periods. Acer LumiFlex auto-boosts contrast when you use this device in direct sunlight – no more squinting when you step outside! Eye-Catching Trendsetter The Aspire Switch 10 E comes in a range of trendy colors that all work perfectly with its dynamic shape and elegant textile-pattern texturing to create one great-looking device. Choose the color that suits you, and watch your friends turn green with envy.
