It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making. Edge-to-edge screen The XPS 13 is the smallest 13.3” laptop ever made, making it perfect for taking to lectures, editing photos between shoots, or working on projects on the go. It manages to be so compact thanks to the edge-to-edge screen, which cuts down the bezel allowing the laptop to be much smaller with sacrificing the screen size. Full HD media The InfinityEdge screen displays all of your content in impressive Full HD. Whether you're editing photos and films or streaming catch-up TV you can enjoy sharp detail, bright colours, and deep contrast. Quad-core Intel® processing The XPS is powered by a powerful quad-core Intel® Core™ i5 processor. Along with fast everyday computing it runs demanding software, such as Photoshop and FL Studio, quickly and smoothly. Whether you're looking for a responsive laptop for working away from home or need a powerful portable studio, you can rely on the XPS 13. Other features The 15-hour battery gives you enough power to use it unplugged through long days out, while USB PowerShare port lets you charge your phone up even when the laptop's running on battery power. Along with two normal USB 3.0 ports, the XPS 13 has a USB-C port. Smaller and able to transmit video, audio, and data, it's a do-all port that's ready to connect to the latest devices and monitors. You can type in comfort in low light thanks to the backlit keyboard too - great for late night sessions at the studio. Microsoft Office & internet security The XPS 13 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making. Edge-to-edge screen The XPS 13 is the smallest 13.3” laptop ever made, making it perfect for taking to lectures, editing photos between shoots, or working on projects on the go. It manages to be so compact thanks to the edge-to-edge screen, which cuts down the bezel allowing the laptop to be much smaller with sacrificing the screen size. Full HD media The InfinityEdge screen displays all of your content in impressive Full HD. Whether you're editing photos and films or streaming catch-up TV you can enjoy sharp detail, bright colours, and deep contrast. Quad-core Intel® processing The XPS is powered by a powerful quad-core Intel® Core™ i5 processor. Along with fast everyday computing it runs demanding software, such as Photoshop and FL Studio, quickly and smoothly. Whether you're looking for a responsive laptop for working away from home or need a powerful portable studio, you can rely on the XPS 13. Other features The 15-hour battery gives you enough power to use it unplugged through long days out, while USB PowerShare port lets you charge your phone up even when the laptop's running on battery power. Along with two normal USB 3.0 ports, the XPS 13 has a USB-C port. Smaller and able to transmit video, audio, and data, it's a do-all port that's ready to connect to the latest devices and monitors. You can type in comfort in low light thanks to the backlit keyboard too - great for late night sessions at the studio. Microsoft Office & internet security The XPS 13 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Whether you're looking for a responsive laptop for working away from home or need a powerful portable studio, you can rely on the XPS 13. Other features The 15-hour battery gives you enough power to use it unplugged through long days out, while USB PowerShare port lets you charge your phone up even when the laptop's running on battery power. Along with two normal USB 3.0 ports, the XPS 13 has a USB-C port. Smaller and able to transmit video, audio, and data, it's a do-all port that's ready to connect to the latest devices and monitors. You can type in comfort in low light thanks to the backlit keyboard too - great for late night sessions at the studio. Microsoft Office & internet security The XPS 13 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
