I am sorry b/c I so wanted to write a wonderful review! I have friends who love their Lenovo (my son too) so I took the plunge. I just wanted an inexpensive laptop so that is why we purchased this one. I should have returned it but it is too late now. When typing there are page up/page down buttons BEFORE the shift key so I am always being taken up to the begin of my text - a real pain. I had to purchase a wireless mouse b/c the finger mouse on the computer is VERY difficult to operate and is difficult to engage. I am always scrolling over something and then my print becomes enormous and I then have to keep resetting it to the default. Also, we NEVER turn it off b/c rebooting it takes FOREVER!!!! This computer is SO SLOW. I was so excited to have something new that would be fast, uh, NO. Oh well, my fault. I did not do my due diligence when reading reviews. Sorry, wish I had better news to share - do not buy this model of Lenovo. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 1 out of 5 by dhdueorkfgs from awful If i could give this laptop a half star review I would . I bought it 4 days ago . From fully charged the batery lasted 2.5 hours , it freezes and is ridiculously slow . I will be returning it tomorrow and upgrading to a better laptop . Date published: 2016-08-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by EmilyElizabeth from Worst Computer This is the first time I purchased a Lenovo and I'm incredibly disappointed. This is the worst computer I've ever had. 1) It is slow. 2) It freezes often. 3) The mouse (on the screen) can freeze, lag, and mis-click. 4) The mouse/touchpad (on the keyboard) is awkward and un-intuitive. 5) It doesn't even have enough power to charge my phone through the USB port. 6) The keyboard is off so it's incredibly difficult to type (the shift button is in the wrong position). 7) You cannot use it for more than a couple of hours before it overheats. 8) There are icons and information cluttered on the computer about Microsoft Office but it's not actually installed on the computer (it's like having commercials installed on my computer). 9) WORST OF ALL: None of the audio/video settings stay. I fix one setting and attempt a program (such as Skype) and it doesn't work. I go back to the settings to see that it has reset. I actually kept the setting box open while I was trying to perform a Skype call and WATCHED the settings change on their own. Nothing I did worked. I cannot perform any sort of meaningful work on this computer since it doesn't type well and I can't have any online meetings. It sabotaged an online interview I had. Yes, I've inquired about returning the computer but all of these problems revealed themselves after the short 15-day return period. Yes, I've called tech support, but unfortunately I do not have the 20+ hours it may take to resolve some of these problems. Date published: 2016-08-20 110-15IBR Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:27CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_61 loc_en_US, sid_BEAB6DF2171A1CFE969C2C6434FC6472_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo Am I able to play csgo on low and heros and generals  Asked by: Tylergray I find it interesting as to how many people will inquire if this is a gaming laptop. I am not into games, but do build custom high end PC's that will play just about anything and then some. I do know, however, that every game comes with the information a user may need as far as the type of PC, laptop or Desktop that will play the game at the rates and intensity that it is meant to be played. I understand also that there are very few programs out there that will put to task the most powerful computer available in order to be played at its best. This is a $250.00 laptop, not a $5,000.00 to $7,500.00 high end "boutique" PC that you will need if you are into gaming beyond maybe "pong". I strongly recommend that in deciding what PC to buy for playing video games, the best thing is to find out what the developer of the game recommends hardware-wise, and shop around for a PC that meets that criteria. However, no matter who makes them, you will not find any 300 dollar laptop that will begin to run any of the newer generation games that are available. I read trade magazines on a regular basis, and the use games to found out which $1000.00 GPU will perform best and in many cases you will two of those alone. You can find low budget PC's under $2000.00 that will do an okay job with some games as long as you don'd expect much in your video experience such as the screen size, the resolution and the smoothness and fluidity of the characters. My guess is that if you want to get into the gaming arena with the people that are really into that and drive 30" plus 4K monitors (Yes, plural) are probably starting out with $3,000.00 plus and when they see how much better their competitors do, they will find themselves into the stratosphere. I couldn't help but making this observation because Iv'e been building high end PC's for decades, and it blows my mind, whether it is a Lenovo, or some other brand, that people buy for 3 or 4 hundred dollars and the complain because they do so well with the game they just purchased. It really helps to make well informed decisions and purchases based on your needs. I think that finding the cheapest thing out there and be disappointed because it doesn't do the job, is not wise and it's not fair to the PC manufacturers. I think that anyone that is well informed, will also be realistic in their expectations. I am sure no one would buy a $20,000.00 car that is red and sleek-looking, and expect that it will be just as good as a Ferrari. Computers are no different. In fact, often, people spend a fortune building a monster PC and they find out that it still doesn't do so well with their favorite game because the components aren't the intended ones. Just like usually, 16 to 32 Gig of RAM are way more than adequate to run pretty much every game, yet they will stick 128 Gig of RAM and install a $120.00 GPU. Doing your homework pays, and asking on this page where they sell $300.00 notebooks, if anyone has played Crysis on them, just isn't very realistic.

I am sorry b/c I so wanted to write a wonderful review! I have friends who love their Lenovo (my son too) so I took the plunge. I just wanted an inexpensive laptop so that is why we purchased this one. I should have returned it but it is too late now. When typing there are page up/page down buttons BEFORE the shift key so I am always being taken up to the begin of my text - a real pain. I had to purchase a wireless mouse b/c the finger mouse on the computer is VERY difficult to operate and is difficult to engage. I am always scrolling over something and then my print becomes enormous and I then have to keep resetting it to the default. Also, we NEVER turn it off b/c rebooting it takes FOREVER!!!! This computer is SO SLOW. I was so excited to have something new that would be fast, uh, NO. Oh well, my fault. I did not do my due diligence when reading reviews. Sorry, wish I had better news to share - do not buy this model of Lenovo. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 1 out of 5 by dhdueorkfgs from awful If i could give this laptop a half star review I would . I bought it 4 days ago . From fully charged the batery lasted 2.5 hours , it freezes and is ridiculously slow . I will be returning it tomorrow and upgrading to a better laptop . Date published: 2016-08-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by EmilyElizabeth from Worst Computer This is the first time I purchased a Lenovo and I'm incredibly disappointed. This is the worst computer I've ever had. 1) It is slow. 2) It freezes often. 3) The mouse (on the screen) can freeze, lag, and mis-click. 4) The mouse/touchpad (on the keyboard) is awkward and un-intuitive. 5) It doesn't even have enough power to charge my phone through the USB port. 6) The keyboard is off so it's incredibly difficult to type (the shift button is in the wrong position). 7) You cannot use it for more than a couple of hours before it overheats. 8) There are icons and information cluttered on the computer about Microsoft Office but it's not actually installed on the computer (it's like having commercials installed on my computer). 9) WORST OF ALL: None of the audio/video settings stay. I fix one setting and attempt a program (such as Skype) and it doesn't work. I go back to the settings to see that it has reset. I actually kept the setting box open while I was trying to perform a Skype call and WATCHED the settings change on their own. Nothing I did worked. I cannot perform any sort of meaningful work on this computer since it doesn't type well and I can't have any online meetings. It sabotaged an online interview I had. Yes, I've inquired about returning the computer but all of these problems revealed themselves after the short 15-day return period. Yes, I've called tech support, but unfortunately I do not have the 20+ hours it may take to resolve some of these problems. Date published: 2016-08-20 110-15IBR Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:27CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_61 loc_en_US, sid_BEAB6DF2171A1CFE969C2C6434FC6472_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo Am I able to play csgo on low and heros and generals  Asked by: Tylergray I find it interesting as to how many people will inquire if this is a gaming laptop. I am not into games, but do build custom high end PC's that will play just about anything and then some. I do know, however, that every game comes with the information a user may need as far as the type of PC, laptop or Desktop that will play the game at the rates and intensity that it is meant to be played. I understand also that there are very few programs out there that will put to task the most powerful computer available in order to be played at its best. This is a $250.00 laptop, not a $5,000.00 to $7,500.00 high end "boutique" PC that you will need if you are into gaming beyond maybe "pong". I strongly recommend that in deciding what PC to buy for playing video games, the best thing is to find out what the developer of the game recommends hardware-wise, and shop around for a PC that meets that criteria. However, no matter who makes them, you will not find any 300 dollar laptop that will begin to run any of the newer generation games that are available. I read trade magazines on a regular basis, and the use games to found out which $1000.00 GPU will perform best and in many cases you will two of those alone. You can find low budget PC's under $2000.00 that will do an okay job with some games as long as you don'd expect much in your video experience such as the screen size, the resolution and the smoothness and fluidity of the characters. My guess is that if you want to get into the gaming arena with the people that are really into that and drive 30" plus 4K monitors (Yes, plural) are probably starting out with $3,000.00 plus and when they see how much better their competitors do, they will find themselves into the stratosphere. I couldn't help but making this observation because Iv'e been building high end PC's for decades, and it blows my mind, whether it is a Lenovo, or some other brand, that people buy for 3 or 4 hundred dollars and the complain because they do so well with the game they just purchased. It really helps to make well informed decisions and purchases based on your needs. I think that finding the cheapest thing out there and be disappointed because it doesn't do the job, is not wise and it's not fair to the PC manufacturers. I think that anyone that is well informed, will also be realistic in their expectations. I am sure no one would buy a $20,000.00 car that is red and sleek-looking, and expect that it will be just as good as a Ferrari. Computers are no different. In fact, often, people spend a fortune building a monster PC and they find out that it still doesn't do so well with their favorite game because the components aren't the intended ones. Just like usually, 16 to 32 Gig of RAM are way more than adequate to run pretty much every game, yet they will stick 128 Gig of RAM and install a $120.00 GPU. Doing your homework pays, and asking on this page where they sell $300.00 notebooks, if anyone has played Crysis on them, just isn't very realistic.

Rated 1 out of 5 by tammy58 from SOOOO SLOW and hard to navigate! I am sorry b/c I so wanted to write a wonderful review! I have friends who love their Lenovo (my son too) so I took the plunge. I just wanted an inexpensive laptop so that is why we purchased this one. I should have returned it but it is too late now. When typing there are page up/page down buttons BEFORE the shift key so I am always being taken up to the begin of my text - a real pain. I had to purchase a wireless mouse b/c the finger mouse on the computer is VERY difficult to operate and is difficult to engage. I am always scrolling over something and then my print becomes enormous and I then have to keep resetting it to the default. Also, we NEVER turn it off b/c rebooting it takes FOREVER!!!! This computer is SO SLOW. I was so excited to have something new that would be fast, uh, NO. Oh well, my fault. I did not do my due diligence when reading reviews. Sorry, wish I had better news to share - do not buy this model of Lenovo. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 1 out of 5 by dhdueorkfgs from awful If i could give this laptop a half star review I would . I bought it 4 days ago . From fully charged the batery lasted 2.5 hours , it freezes and is ridiculously slow . I will be returning it tomorrow and upgrading to a better laptop . Date published: 2016-08-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by EmilyElizabeth from Worst Computer This is the first time I purchased a Lenovo and I'm incredibly disappointed. This is the worst computer I've ever had. 1) It is slow. 2) It freezes often. 3) The mouse (on the screen) can freeze, lag, and mis-click. 4) The mouse/touchpad (on the keyboard) is awkward and un-intuitive. 5) It doesn't even have enough power to charge my phone through the USB port. 6) The keyboard is off so it's incredibly difficult to type (the shift button is in the wrong position). 7) You cannot use it for more than a couple of hours before it overheats. 8) There are icons and information cluttered on the computer about Microsoft Office but it's not actually installed on the computer (it's like having commercials installed on my computer). 9) WORST OF ALL: None of the audio/video settings stay. I fix one setting and attempt a program (such as Skype) and it doesn't work. I go back to the settings to see that it has reset. I actually kept the setting box open while I was trying to perform a Skype call and WATCHED the settings change on their own. Nothing I did worked. I cannot perform any sort of meaningful work on this computer since it doesn't type well and I can't have any online meetings. It sabotaged an online interview I had. Yes, I've inquired about returning the computer but all of these problems revealed themselves after the short 15-day return period. Yes, I've called tech support, but unfortunately I do not have the 20+ hours it may take to resolve some of these problems.

Am I able to play csgo on low and heros and generals  Asked by: Tylergray I find it interesting as to how many people will inquire if this is a gaming laptop. I am not into games, but do build custom high end PC's that will play just about anything and then some. I do know, however, that every game comes with the information a user may need as far as the type of PC, laptop or Desktop that will play the game at the rates and intensity that it is meant to be played. I understand also that there are very few programs out there that will put to task the most powerful computer available in order to be played at its best. This is a $250.00 laptop, not a $5,000.00 to $7,500.00 high end "boutique" PC that you will need if you are into gaming beyond maybe "pong". I strongly recommend that in deciding what PC to buy for playing video games, the best thing is to find out what the developer of the game recommends hardware-wise, and shop around for a PC that meets that criteria. However, no matter who makes them, you will not find any 300 dollar laptop that will begin to run any of the newer generation games that are available. I read trade magazines on a regular basis, and the use games to found out which $1000.00 GPU will perform best and in many cases you will two of those alone. You can find low budget PC's under $2000.00 that will do an okay job with some games as long as you don'd expect much in your video experience such as the screen size, the resolution and the smoothness and fluidity of the characters. My guess is that if you want to get into the gaming arena with the people that are really into that and drive 30" plus 4K monitors (Yes, plural) are probably starting out with $3,000.00 plus and when they see how much better their competitors do, they will find themselves into the stratosphere. I couldn't help but making this observation because Iv'e been building high end PC's for decades, and it blows my mind, whether it is a Lenovo, or some other brand, that people buy for 3 or 4 hundred dollars and the complain because they do so well with the game they just purchased. It really helps to make well informed decisions and purchases based on your needs. I think that finding the cheapest thing out there and be disappointed because it doesn't do the job, is not wise and it's not fair to the PC manufacturers. I think that anyone that is well informed, will also be realistic in their expectations. I am sure no one would buy a $20,000.00 car that is red and sleek-looking, and expect that it will be just as good as a Ferrari. Computers are no different. In fact, often, people spend a fortune building a monster PC and they find out that it still doesn't do so well with their favorite game because the components aren't the intended ones. Just like usually, 16 to 32 Gig of RAM are way more than adequate to run pretty much every game, yet they will stick 128 Gig of RAM and install a $120.00 GPU. Doing your homework pays, and asking on this page where they sell $300.00 notebooks, if anyone has played Crysis on them, just isn't very realistic. Answered by: ConcreteBrew Date published: 2016-09-28 what about photoshop usage? would the program runs smooth on this laptop for casual/simple images editing & gifs/animation making? Asked by: solarise This machine does not have the necessary processor to run Photoshop CC 2015. The Ideapad 110 has an Intel Celeron processor 1.6GHz, and Photoshop needs at least the following minimum requirements: Intel® Core 2 or AMD Athlon® 64 processor; 2 GHz or faster processor Microsoft Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 2 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended) 2.6 GB of available hard-disk space for 32-bit installation; 3.1 GB of available hard-disk space for 64-bit installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on a volume that uses a case-sensitive file system) 1024 x 768 display (1280x800 recommended) with 16-bit color and 512 MB of dedicated VRAM; 2 GB is recommended* OpenGL 2.0–capable system Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, validation of subscriptions, and access to online services.** Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-10-13 Hi, I bought this model for my homebased job.
