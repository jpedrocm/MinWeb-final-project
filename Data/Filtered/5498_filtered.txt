Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by steve409 Super Cool convertible, and the price! Wow. I had to give up my MacBook Air in exchange for a clunker ThinkPad when I changed jobs. The Thinkpad was so bolted down by IT security it's barely useable. Decided to see what's out there for personal use. I found this little gem and glad I did. Fast boot, removable tablet, 12" monitor, light weight and slim, with great battery life (6-8 hours anyway), and a comfortable keyboard for extended typing. Mine came with 4g ram and 128g SSHD, all for $450. I was conditioned to think that I'd need to spend twice that amount to get something like this. I'm impressed. I'll probably buy a second one for my wife. Only downside, if you think of it as such, is the limited disk space. I've grown used to using OneDrive for all my files which makes it easy to get to them from any device so the size of the disk drive isn't a huge issue for me. But if you need to install a lot of programs and keep large amounts of data resident, this might not be the machine for you. It's also not an optimum machine for hardcore games, by a long stretch. But for doing everyday computing tasks, this is a great machine, and did I mention it was only $450!! August 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by bbyers perfect choice bought another 2 in 1 and took it back in 2 days, this one I bought hoping it would fit the bill. My wife loves it and it will make a great traveling laptop for half the price of other models. give it a try! August 11, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Gus2 Does everything I need. The only complaint I have is that the battery does not last very long. Great machine though. May 14, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Nope Does not come with Active Stylus The Specs state that an Active Stylus is in the box. This is in fact, incorrect. I've ordered two units and neither have it. For now, I can not recommend the product due to false advertising. If this changes, I will change my review of this product.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by steve409 Super Cool convertible, and the price! Wow. I had to give up my MacBook Air in exchange for a clunker ThinkPad when I changed jobs. The Thinkpad was so bolted down by IT security it's barely useable. Decided to see what's out there for personal use. I found this little gem and glad I did. Fast boot, removable tablet, 12" monitor, light weight and slim, with great battery life (6-8 hours anyway), and a comfortable keyboard for extended typing. Mine came with 4g ram and 128g SSHD, all for $450. I was conditioned to think that I'd need to spend twice that amount to get something like this. I'm impressed. I'll probably buy a second one for my wife. Only downside, if you think of it as such, is the limited disk space. I've grown used to using OneDrive for all my files which makes it easy to get to them from any device so the size of the disk drive isn't a huge issue for me. But if you need to install a lot of programs and keep large amounts of data resident, this might not be the machine for you. It's also not an optimum machine for hardcore games, by a long stretch. But for doing everyday computing tasks, this is a great machine, and did I mention it was only $450!! August 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by bbyers perfect choice bought another 2 in 1 and took it back in 2 days, this one I bought hoping it would fit the bill. My wife loves it and it will make a great traveling laptop for half the price of other models. give it a try! August 11, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Gus2 Does everything I need. The only complaint I have is that the battery does not last very long. Great machine though. May 14, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Nope Does not come with Active Stylus The Specs state that an Active Stylus is in the box. This is in fact, incorrect. I've ordered two units and neither have it. For now, I can not recommend the product due to false advertising. If this changes, I will change my review of this product.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by steve409 Super Cool convertible, and the price! Wow. I had to give up my MacBook Air in exchange for a clunker ThinkPad when I changed jobs. The Thinkpad was so bolted down by IT security it's barely useable. Decided to see what's out there for personal use. I found this little gem and glad I did. Fast boot, removable tablet, 12" monitor, light weight and slim, with great battery life (6-8 hours anyway), and a comfortable keyboard for extended typing. Mine came with 4g ram and 128g SSHD, all for $450. I was conditioned to think that I'd need to spend twice that amount to get something like this. I'm impressed. I'll probably buy a second one for my wife. Only downside, if you think of it as such, is the limited disk space. I've grown used to using OneDrive for all my files which makes it easy to get to them from any device so the size of the disk drive isn't a huge issue for me. But if you need to install a lot of programs and keep large amounts of data resident, this might not be the machine for you. It's also not an optimum machine for hardcore games, by a long stretch. But for doing everyday computing tasks, this is a great machine, and did I mention it was only $450!! August 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by bbyers perfect choice bought another 2 in 1 and took it back in 2 days, this one I bought hoping it would fit the bill. My wife loves it and it will make a great traveling laptop for half the price of other models. give it a try! August 11, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Gus2 Does everything I need. The only complaint I have is that the battery does not last very long. Great machine though. May 14, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Nope Does not come with Active Stylus The Specs state that an Active Stylus is in the box. This is in fact, incorrect. I've ordered two units and neither have it. For now, I can not recommend the product due to false advertising. If this changes, I will change my review of this product.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by steve409 Super Cool convertible, and the price! Wow. I had to give up my MacBook Air in exchange for a clunker ThinkPad when I changed jobs. The Thinkpad was so bolted down by IT security it's barely useable. Decided to see what's out there for personal use. I found this little gem and glad I did. Fast boot, removable tablet, 12" monitor, light weight and slim, with great battery life (6-8 hours anyway), and a comfortable keyboard for extended typing. Mine came with 4g ram and 128g SSHD, all for $450. I was conditioned to think that I'd need to spend twice that amount to get something like this. I'm impressed. I'll probably buy a second one for my wife. Only downside, if you think of it as such, is the limited disk space. I've grown used to using OneDrive for all my files which makes it easy to get to them from any device so the size of the disk drive isn't a huge issue for me. But if you need to install a lot of programs and keep large amounts of data resident, this might not be the machine for you. It's also not an optimum machine for hardcore games, by a long stretch. But for doing everyday computing tasks, this is a great machine, and did I mention it was only $450!! August 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by bbyers perfect choice bought another 2 in 1 and took it back in 2 days, this one I bought hoping it would fit the bill. My wife loves it and it will make a great traveling laptop for half the price of other models. give it a try! August 11, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Gus2 Does everything I need.

May 14, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Nope Does not come with Active Stylus The Specs state that an Active Stylus is in the box. This is in fact, incorrect. I've ordered two units and neither have it.

Does everything I need.
The only complaint I have is that the battery does not last very long. Great machine though.
Rated 1 out of 5 by Nope Does not come with Active Stylus The Specs state that an Active Stylus is in the box. This is in fact, incorrect. I've ordered two units and neither have it. For now, I can not recommend the product due to false advertising. If this changes, I will change my review of this product. February 16, 2016
