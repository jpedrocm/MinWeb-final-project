Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles 3 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Slimmer, lighter and more powerful than previous versions, the Surface Pro 4 is the most advanced Microsoft 2 in 1 ever. Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Slimmer, lighter and more powerful than previous versions, the Surface Pro 4 is the most advanced Microsoft 2 in 1 ever. Along with reduced size and improved performance, it features a larger visible screen area, magnetic Surface Pen, 3D camera and a more sensitive touchscreen for improved precision. Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Advanced PC performance The Surface Pro 4 is a genuine alternative to a full-sized laptop. It can effortlessly run all your favourite Windows programs and apps, from photo editing software to the entire Microsoft Office suite. Unlike most tablets, which are powered by micro-processors, the Surface Pro 4 features a high-tech Intel® Core™ M processor. During everyday computing it consumes little power for increased battery life. However, should you need more performance for demanding tasks, the processing speed increases to match, so you always have the speed you need without sacrificing battery life. Tablet portability The combination of 10-point multitouch screen and compact dimensions make the Surface Pro 4 a truly mobile device. Plus, thanks to a better-than-HD display, you can enjoy your films, games and images in beautiful detail wherever you are. Included is the magnetic Surface pen that lets you annotate documents, make notes or draw with the same precision you would get on paper. When not in use, it magnetically attaches to the side of your Surface for easy access. Connecting an optional touch or type cover provides the Surface Pro 4 with a full sized keyboard that's perfect for typing long documents. Premium design The magnesium case provides a smooth, durable surface that's a delight to hold, while the integrated kick stand provides two standing positions that are perfect for watching films or typing. Made for Windows 10 Surface Pro 4 is made for Windows 10. The 3D camera supports Windows Hello - a revolutionary way to access your personal information. Using biometric facial scanning, it unlocks your Windows account as soon as you're facing the screen, and when you leave, your account locks again. This means your files and data are kept secure and you never have to input a password when you need to work. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. __________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
