I purchased the 256SSD, with 8 G of RAM and Intel i7 chip, it's easily the best laptop I've owned and with a coupon, I got it for just over $700. This is a solid laptop, it feels solid, it runs fast, boot up time is about 5 seconds. It's extremely silent. Mostly use it for data sorting and analysis on the go. And it work s beautifully. Now that I've listed there good, I have to be fair and list the not so good. There keyboard and track pad can sometimes be a tad unresponsive, it my just bebecause I'm still getting used to the laptop. It's still a really great trackpad, and keyboard. Just not as good as the rest of the laptop. Date published: 2016-09-03 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mathew Philip from Amazing laptop I just bought this item last week and it works amazingly. It looks elegant and beautiful with super fast WiFi performance and light weight. Recommended for home, office and travel. Worth buying it and a must buy. Date published: 2016-06-16 Rated 4 out of 5 by burntsianna from Nice screen I just bought this laptop. I think it looks really nice and operates well. As another review mentioned, the placement of the right shift key is SUPER frustrating; I hadn't realized that I exclusively use it until I bought this computer and I have small hands so it makes it very difficult to use it and reach any of the other keys with the same hand. I suppose I could learn to use the left shift key, but I am not left handed so it is more natural to use the right. The fan on the computer is a bit louder than I'd like, and it off and on frequently with use. That all said, most of the time I'll use this laptop with an external display and keyboard, so hopefully these issues will not prevent me from enjoying its overall functionality.

I purchased the 256SSD, with 8 G of RAM and Intel i7 chip, it's easily the best laptop I've owned and with a coupon, I got it for just over $700. This is a solid laptop, it feels solid, it runs fast, boot up time is about 5 seconds. It's extremely silent. Mostly use it for data sorting and analysis on the go. And it work s beautifully. Now that I've listed there good, I have to be fair and list the not so good. There keyboard and track pad can sometimes be a tad unresponsive, it my just bebecause I'm still getting used to the laptop. It's still a really great trackpad, and keyboard. Just not as good as the rest of the laptop. Date published: 2016-09-03 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mathew Philip from Amazing laptop I just bought this item last week and it works amazingly. It looks elegant and beautiful with super fast WiFi performance and light weight. Recommended for home, office and travel. Worth buying it and a must buy. Date published: 2016-06-16 Rated 4 out of 5 by burntsianna from Nice screen I just bought this laptop. I think it looks really nice and operates well. As another review mentioned, the placement of the right shift key is SUPER frustrating; I hadn't realized that I exclusively use it until I bought this computer and I have small hands so it makes it very difficult to use it and reach any of the other keys with the same hand. I suppose I could learn to use the left shift key, but I am not left handed so it is more natural to use the right. The fan on the computer is a bit louder than I'd like, and it off and on frequently with use. That all said, most of the time I'll use this laptop with an external display and keyboard, so hopefully these issues will not prevent me from enjoying its overall functionality.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Kenea from Easily the best laptop I've owned. I purchased the 256SSD, with 8 G of RAM and Intel i7 chip, it's easily the best laptop I've owned and with a coupon, I got it for just over $700. This is a solid laptop, it feels solid, it runs fast, boot up time is about 5 seconds. It's extremely silent. Mostly use it for data sorting and analysis on the go. And it work s beautifully. Now that I've listed there good, I have to be fair and list the not so good. There keyboard and track pad can sometimes be a tad unresponsive, it my just bebecause I'm still getting used to the laptop. It's still a really great trackpad, and keyboard. Just not as good as the rest of the laptop. Date published: 2016-09-03 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mathew Philip from Amazing laptop I just bought this item last week and it works amazingly. It looks elegant and beautiful with super fast WiFi performance and light weight. Recommended for home, office and travel. Worth buying it and a must buy. Date published: 2016-06-16 Rated 4 out of 5 by burntsianna from Nice screen I just bought this laptop. I think it looks really nice and operates well. As another review mentioned, the placement of the right shift key is SUPER frustrating; I hadn't realized that I exclusively use it until I bought this computer and I have small hands so it makes it very difficult to use it and reach any of the other keys with the same hand. I suppose I could learn to use the left shift key, but I am not left handed so it is more natural to use the right. The fan on the computer is a bit louder than I'd like, and it off and on frequently with use. That all said, most of the time I'll use this laptop with an external display and keyboard, so hopefully these issues will not prevent me from enjoying its overall functionality.
