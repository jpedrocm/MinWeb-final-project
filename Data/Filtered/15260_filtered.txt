Built for computing on the go, the Transformer Book has up to 11 hours of battery life, letting you stay connected throughout the whole day without needing a charge. And with a micro-USB charging port, you can use a phone charger to top up the battery if you ever get caught out on a long journey.

It's ideal for social media, making notes, email, and shopping online. 2 in 1 Featuring a brand new reversible hinge, the Asus Transformer Book can switch between being a compact laptop and an intuitive tablet. For extra versatility, the tablet can be detached completely and reattached at a different angle for two completely different modes. Designed to complement your life, you can use the keyboard as a stand when you're watching videos online, or switch to tablet mode for easy social media navigation then re-attach the keyboard to quickly make some notes for an essay. With Windows 10 Continuum mode, the Transformer Book will automatically detect whether the keyboard is attached and adapt the interface to suit either touch or keyboard setups.   Reliable everyday computing Powered by a quad-core Intel® Atom™ x5 Processor, you can multitask seamlessly to get through all your daily tasks with ease. Shop online, buy festival tickets, and check your emails quicker with the latest AC WiFi technology, which lets you connect to strong and stable signals. Less prone to interference, AC WiFi is also perfect for streaming films and catching up with TV without worrying about long load times. Built for computing on the go, the Transformer Book has up to 11 hours of battery life, letting you stay connected throughout the whole day without needing a charge. And with a micro-USB charging port, you can use a phone charger to top up the battery if you ever get caught out on a long journey. Lightweight design for computing on the go Designed using aluminium to withstand everyday knocks and scuffs, the Transformer Book T101HA is tough, yet light – with the tablet weighing in at only 580g. With a travel-friendly 19mm thickness, the T101HA is perfect for tucking into your bag. Microsoft Office & internet security The Transformer Book doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Top features: - 2 in 1 design with tablet and laptop modes - Quad-core Intel® Atom™ Processor for reliable computing - Aluminium body for a tough, yet lightweight feel Social The Asus Transformer Book is part of our Social range, which features great-value laptops designed to keep you connected to what matters. It's ideal for social media, making notes, email, and shopping online. 2 in 1 Featuring a brand new reversible hinge, the Asus Transformer Book can switch between being a compact laptop and an intuitive tablet. For extra versatility, the tablet can be detached completely and reattached at a different angle for two completely different modes. Designed to complement your life, you can use the keyboard as a stand when you're watching videos online, or switch to tablet mode for easy social media navigation then re-attach the keyboard to quickly make some notes for an essay. With Windows 10 Continuum mode, the Transformer Book will automatically detect whether the keyboard is attached and adapt the interface to suit either touch or keyboard setups.   Reliable everyday computing Powered by a quad-core Intel® Atom™ x5 Processor, you can multitask seamlessly to get through all your daily tasks with ease. Shop online, buy festival tickets, and check your emails quicker with the latest AC WiFi technology, which lets you connect to strong and stable signals. Less prone to interference, AC WiFi is also perfect for streaming films and catching up with TV without worrying about long load times. Built for computing on the go, the Transformer Book has up to 11 hours of battery life, letting you stay connected throughout the whole day without needing a charge. And with a micro-USB charging port, you can use a phone charger to top up the battery if you ever get caught out on a long journey. Lightweight design for computing on the go Designed using aluminium to withstand everyday knocks and scuffs, the Transformer Book T101HA is tough, yet light – with the tablet weighing in at only 580g. With a travel-friendly 19mm thickness, the T101HA is perfect for tucking into your bag. Microsoft Office & internet security The Transformer Book doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
