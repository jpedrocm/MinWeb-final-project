The smallest 13-inch on the planet with the world’s first InfinityEdge display More screen, less to carry: The virtually borderless InfinityEdge display maximizes screen space by squeezing a 13-inch display in an 11-inch frame. With a bezel only 5.2 mm thin, weighing in at only 2.7 pounds and measuring a super slim 9-15 mm, the XPS 13 is exceptionally thin and light. Stunning, state-of-the-art display Stunning UltraSharp QHD+ resolution (3200x1800): An optional upgrade gives you eye-popping detail with 5.7 million pixels (276 ppi).
