During the period of thinking about what I was going to buy I was doing a lot of live chats with employees to see which laptop was the best for the right price, and they undermined the abilities of this laptop. They said that this laptop wouldn't be very good for handling programs like android studio, which are very hardy programs that require lots of energy, and it wouldn't be very good for any games other than very minor gaming and I have a full cache of games loaded on here, as well as a bunch of movies. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by Giaco from Good overall computer I ordered this computer online, and they sent me one that had a broken "e" key. It was extremely difficult to type, so I send it back. Luckily, they paid for the shipping and the new one works beautifully. The screen is huge and has great color. The speakers are really great, and get louder than my $2000 desktop's speakers. The one thing that is really annoying is the bad placement of the right shift key. It is tiny, and placed so that it is easy to accidentally hit the arrow keys and switch lines. Other than that, it is a very good computer. The large hard drive is a huge plus Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by Jana from Very slow and hangs often.. Often hangs and takes very long to load...every time I use the laptop, atleast need to waste 1 hour unnecessarily...

Asked by: BM_NYC I bought the computer specifically to run Lightroom and Photoshop. I am disappointed in the performance. Answered by: Sfrancis16 Date published: 2016-10-10 Can you install a second hard drive to Ideapad 310? Is it possible to take out the optical drive and add a second hard drive? I am planning to install SSD on it but still keep the 1TB as a secondary hard drive on board. Asked by: jinlee I am not certain, though I would imagine so...that being said I would check with a Lenovo technical customer service rep. (I am just a customer.) Answered by: EdwH Date published: 2016-10-05 Can you play rrgular DVDs on this laptop or just blu-ray Asked by: Pops1947 I'm sorry I haven't tried either.

During the period of thinking about what I was going to buy I was doing a lot of live chats with employees to see which laptop was the best for the right price, and they undermined the abilities of this laptop. They said that this laptop wouldn't be very good for handling programs like android studio, which are very hardy programs that require lots of energy, and it wouldn't be very good for any games other than very minor gaming and I have a full cache of games loaded on here, as well as a bunch of movies. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by Giaco from Good overall computer I ordered this computer online, and they sent me one that had a broken "e" key. It was extremely difficult to type, so I send it back. Luckily, they paid for the shipping and the new one works beautifully. The screen is huge and has great color. The speakers are really great, and get louder than my $2000 desktop's speakers. The one thing that is really annoying is the bad placement of the right shift key. It is tiny, and placed so that it is easy to accidentally hit the arrow keys and switch lines. Other than that, it is a very good computer. The large hard drive is a huge plus Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by Jana from Very slow and hangs often.. Often hangs and takes very long to load...every time I use the laptop, atleast need to waste 1 hour unnecessarily...

Asked by: BM_NYC I bought the computer specifically to run Lightroom and Photoshop. I am disappointed in the performance. Answered by: Sfrancis16 Date published: 2016-10-10 Can you install a second hard drive to Ideapad 310? Is it possible to take out the optical drive and add a second hard drive? I am planning to install SSD on it but still keep the 1TB as a secondary hard drive on board. Asked by: jinlee I am not certain, though I would imagine so...that being said I would check with a Lenovo technical customer service rep. (I am just a customer.) Answered by: EdwH Date published: 2016-10-05 Can you play rrgular DVDs on this laptop or just blu-ray Asked by: Pops1947 I'm sorry I haven't tried either. I got it for my son and his generation only views stuff from on line services.

Rated 5 out of 5 by redwire12 from Amazing for this price range I bought this laptop for my programming classes at school and I thought that would be all i would be able to use it for, but I found out that this is great for multitasking and taking notes for all of my classes. During the period of thinking about what I was going to buy I was doing a lot of live chats with employees to see which laptop was the best for the right price, and they undermined the abilities of this laptop. They said that this laptop wouldn't be very good for handling programs like android studio, which are very hardy programs that require lots of energy, and it wouldn't be very good for any games other than very minor gaming and I have a full cache of games loaded on here, as well as a bunch of movies. Date published: 2016-09-01 Rated 4 out of 5 by Giaco from Good overall computer I ordered this computer online, and they sent me one that had a broken "e" key. It was extremely difficult to type, so I send it back. Luckily, they paid for the shipping and the new one works beautifully. The screen is huge and has great color. The speakers are really great, and get louder than my $2000 desktop's speakers. The one thing that is really annoying is the bad placement of the right shift key. It is tiny, and placed so that it is easy to accidentally hit the arrow keys and switch lines. Other than that, it is a very good computer. The large hard drive is a huge plus Date published: 2016-09-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by Jana from Very slow and hangs often.. Often hangs and takes very long to load...every time I use the laptop, atleast need to waste 1 hour unnecessarily...

Amazing for this price range
I bought this laptop for my programming classes at school and I thought that would be all i would be able to use it for, but I found out that this is great for multitasking and taking notes for all of my classes. During the period of thinking about what I was going to buy I was doing a lot of live chats with employees to see which laptop was the best for the right price, and they undermined the abilities of this laptop. They said that this laptop wouldn't be very good for handling programs like android studio, which are very hardy programs that require lots of energy, and it wouldn't be very good for any games other than very minor gaming and I have a full cache of games loaded on here, as well as a bunch of movies.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Giaco from Good overall computer I ordered this computer online, and they sent me one that had a broken "e" key. It was extremely difficult to type, so I send it back. Luckily, they paid for the shipping and the new one works beautifully. The screen is huge and has great color. The speakers are really great, and get louder than my $2000 desktop's speakers. The one thing that is really annoying is the bad placement of the right shift key. It is tiny, and placed so that it is easy to accidentally hit the arrow keys and switch lines. Other than that, it is a very good computer. The large hard drive is a huge plus Date published: 2016-09-15

Will the model 80SM003SUS be able to handle Adobe Photoshop? Asked by: BM_NYC I bought the computer specifically to run Lightroom and Photoshop. I am disappointed in the performance. Answered by: Sfrancis16 Date published: 2016-10-10 Can you install a second hard drive to Ideapad 310? Is it possible to take out the optical drive and add a second hard drive? I am planning to install SSD on it but still keep the 1TB as a secondary hard drive on board. Asked by: jinlee I am not certain, though I would imagine so...that being said I would check with a Lenovo technical customer service rep. (I am just a customer.) Answered by: EdwH Date published: 2016-10-05 Can you play rrgular DVDs on this laptop or just blu-ray Asked by: Pops1947 I'm sorry I haven't tried either. I got it for my son and his generation only views stuff from on line services.
