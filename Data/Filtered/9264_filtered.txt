I liked the cover material, feels tough and like an original thinkpad series. so far the battery runs about 5-6 hours on 80% of screen brightness and simple document work. its reduced 4-5 hours when surf on internet. even 3-4 when watch movie with speaker on. i dont know how it can last up to 10 hours. probably i have to turn downs the screen to 10% brightness and no major CPU running at all, which is not practical. Pen is useful and very good for those who do arts. and the different modes of the laptop is very useful for me and its my first time using Yoga model. Date published: 2016-01-25 Rated 1 out of 5 by Juris from Faulty laptop The delivery took about 5 weeks after purchase although it was stated 7 working days to deliver. The laptop is giving blue screen every second day since begining (e.g SYSTEM_PTE_MISUSE, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, etc.) although all updates were applied. So I did complete reset, but after that it's freezing/hanging every 10 minutes without any errors. Waste of my time! Date published: 2016-04-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Lilia from Almost perfect The computer has almost all I want in a business laptop: fast, lots of memory, great keyboard, a track point, touchscreen, thin and light, hopefully good battery life (yet to be tested). However, I wanted a smaller computer and I don't understand why this was not possible: the screen (physical part) is 15" but the display (visible part) is 12.5". I really wanted a 13" with 12" or so display. The same problem I have with the keyboard: there is no need for such a wide computer because the keyboard fits nicely on an 8"x11.5" computer. The best overall computer dimensions i wanted was 8"x11.5" but I had to compromise for 8.5"x12.2".

That is 16 GB total with only the DDR4 slot available to upgrade? What is the benefit of this over say 16GB DDR4-2133? Asked by: Bookstastegood Memory is only one component of the entire system, some computers with tons of memory can be absolutely slow, while others with a little memory are truly fast. But depending on what you are wanting to accomplish with your choice of PC, 16GB will allow you to open more resource intensive applications, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Dreamweaver etc., without much loss of performance. But whether you can open those will also depend on the CPU (central processing unit), whether you have a solid-state vs. a traditional spin drive, what kind of memory the graphics chip uses (discrete vs. your 8GB or 16Gb DDR4 memory), and a host of other specs. Take some time to reflect on what you're going to use it for, then go from there. Answered by: albuj789 Date published: 2016-10-03 Why the yoga 260 is more expensive than yoga X1? it is unreasonable. Asked by: oitvx Uh, most likely because it is a mew model. Answered by: Knowmorethanu Date published: 2016-03-25 Does it have NFC and WAN (3G, 4G) modules? Will there be models with i7 CPU?  Asked by: Andrew327 The 4G LTE card will become available sometime in April, according to the Lenovo salesperson I spoke to. But you cannot buy it separately and install it yourself. You need to buy the laptop with it.

I liked the cover material, feels tough and like an original thinkpad series. so far the battery runs about 5-6 hours on 80% of screen brightness and simple document work. its reduced 4-5 hours when surf on internet. even 3-4 when watch movie with speaker on. i dont know how it can last up to 10 hours. probably i have to turn downs the screen to 10% brightness and no major CPU running at all, which is not practical. Pen is useful and very good for those who do arts. and the different modes of the laptop is very useful for me and its my first time using Yoga model. Date published: 2016-01-25 Rated 1 out of 5 by Juris from Faulty laptop The delivery took about 5 weeks after purchase although it was stated 7 working days to deliver. The laptop is giving blue screen every second day since begining (e.g SYSTEM_PTE_MISUSE, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, etc.) although all updates were applied. So I did complete reset, but after that it's freezing/hanging every 10 minutes without any errors. Waste of my time! Date published: 2016-04-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Lilia from Almost perfect The computer has almost all I want in a business laptop: fast, lots of memory, great keyboard, a track point, touchscreen, thin and light, hopefully good battery life (yet to be tested). However, I wanted a smaller computer and I don't understand why this was not possible: the screen (physical part) is 15" but the display (visible part) is 12.5". I really wanted a 13" with 12" or so display. The same problem I have with the keyboard: there is no need for such a wide computer because the keyboard fits nicely on an 8"x11.5" computer. The best overall computer dimensions i wanted was 8"x11.5" but I had to compromise for 8.5"x12.2".

That is 16 GB total with only the DDR4 slot available to upgrade? What is the benefit of this over say 16GB DDR4-2133? Asked by: Bookstastegood Memory is only one component of the entire system, some computers with tons of memory can be absolutely slow, while others with a little memory are truly fast. But depending on what you are wanting to accomplish with your choice of PC, 16GB will allow you to open more resource intensive applications, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Dreamweaver etc., without much loss of performance. But whether you can open those will also depend on the CPU (central processing unit), whether you have a solid-state vs. a traditional spin drive, what kind of memory the graphics chip uses (discrete vs. your 8GB or 16Gb DDR4 memory), and a host of other specs. Take some time to reflect on what you're going to use it for, then go from there. Answered by: albuj789 Date published: 2016-10-03 Why the yoga 260 is more expensive than yoga X1? it is unreasonable. Asked by: oitvx Uh, most likely because it is a mew model. Answered by: Knowmorethanu Date published: 2016-03-25 Does it have NFC and WAN (3G, 4G) modules? Will there be models with i7 CPU?  Asked by: Andrew327 The 4G LTE card will become available sometime in April, according to the Lenovo salesperson I spoke to. But you cannot buy it separately and install it yourself. You need to buy the laptop with it.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Uuganaa from Portable Friend I got one with i7 and 16gb ram through Singapore online. super fast and turns on and off in 10 secs. I liked the cover material, feels tough and like an original thinkpad series. so far the battery runs about 5-6 hours on 80% of screen brightness and simple document work. its reduced 4-5 hours when surf on internet. even 3-4 when watch movie with speaker on. i dont know how it can last up to 10 hours. probably i have to turn downs the screen to 10% brightness and no major CPU running at all, which is not practical. Pen is useful and very good for those who do arts. and the different modes of the laptop is very useful for me and its my first time using Yoga model. Date published: 2016-01-25 Rated 1 out of 5 by Juris from Faulty laptop The delivery took about 5 weeks after purchase although it was stated 7 working days to deliver. The laptop is giving blue screen every second day since begining (e.g SYSTEM_PTE_MISUSE, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, etc.) although all updates were applied. So I did complete reset, but after that it's freezing/hanging every 10 minutes without any errors. Waste of my time! Date published: 2016-04-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Lilia from Almost perfect The computer has almost all I want in a business laptop: fast, lots of memory, great keyboard, a track point, touchscreen, thin and light, hopefully good battery life (yet to be tested). However, I wanted a smaller computer and I don't understand why this was not possible: the screen (physical part) is 15" but the display (visible part) is 12.5". I really wanted a 13" with 12" or so display. The same problem I have with the keyboard: there is no need for such a wide computer because the keyboard fits nicely on an 8"x11.5" computer. The best overall computer dimensions i wanted was 8"x11.5" but I had to compromise for 8.5"x12.2".

Just to be clear, the top end configuration states 8GB DDR4-2133 8GB Onboard for memory. That is 16 GB total with only the DDR4 slot available to upgrade? What is the benefit of this over say 16GB DDR4-2133? Asked by: Bookstastegood Memory is only one component of the entire system, some computers with tons of memory can be absolutely slow, while others with a little memory are truly fast. But depending on what you are wanting to accomplish with your choice of PC, 16GB will allow you to open more resource intensive applications, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Dreamweaver etc., without much loss of performance. But whether you can open those will also depend on the CPU (central processing unit), whether you have a solid-state vs. a traditional spin drive, what kind of memory the graphics chip uses (discrete vs. your 8GB or 16Gb DDR4 memory), and a host of other specs. Take some time to reflect on what you're going to use it for, then go from there. Answered by: albuj789 Date published: 2016-10-03 Why the yoga 260 is more expensive than yoga X1? it is unreasonable. Asked by: oitvx Uh, most likely because it is a mew model. Answered by: Knowmorethanu Date published: 2016-03-25 Does it have NFC and WAN (3G, 4G) modules? Will there be models with i7 CPU?  Asked by: Andrew327 The 4G LTE card will become available sometime in April, according to the Lenovo salesperson I spoke to.
