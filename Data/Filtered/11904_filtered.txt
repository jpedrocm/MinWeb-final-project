Intel Enhanced SpeedStep® Technology Now get even more performance enhancing, energy conserving benefits from Intel. With SpeedStep technology, your processor simultaneously switches voltage and frequency to high or low levels depending on processor load. Enhanced SpeedStep technology performs voltage and frequency changes separately so the system performs better with reduced latency due to system unavailability. Thermal Monitoring Technologies This feature is designed to protect the processor in the event of unusual circumstances such as cooling fan failure which can cause damage if internal chassis temperatures become higher than normal. It works by reducing the processor's power consumption if the programmed thermal temperature is exceeded. The processor contains a thermal diode which measures the actual CPU temperature and relays its temperature and thermal requirements to the motherboard. The motherboard uses those requirements to control the processor fan and ensure it does not spin faster than necessary - even under worst case power use.

Intel Secure Key Intel Secure Key is a feature designed to keep your data and personal information safe by strengthening encryption capability via a digital random number generator. Execute Disable Bit Reduces your system's exposure to viruses and mal-ware attacks, and the chances of self-executing and propagating software from taking down your system or network.

This type of hard drive has an integrated controller which supports the drive. A SATA interface connects an ATA hard drive to the computer's motherboard. The advantage of SATA is speed, smaller cables, and it uses a separate bus. Smaller cables can easily be stowed out of the way of other components. This also promotes better airflow within the case helping to keep your system cooler. What can you do with a 500GB Serial ATA hard drive? You can store up to 107,000 songs or 85,000 photos.

Intel 64 Take advantage of 64-bit computing when using 64-bit compatible software. This architecture enables systems to access more than 4GB of virtual and physical memory. Also known as EM64T, it is fully compatible with 32-bit operating systems giving you the flexibility to upgrade to a 64-bit OS when ever you're ready. Intel's 64 architecture works on servers, workstations, desktops, and mobile platforms. Intel Enhanced SpeedStep® Technology Now get even more performance enhancing, energy conserving benefits from Intel. With SpeedStep technology, your processor simultaneously switches voltage and frequency to high or low levels depending on processor load. Enhanced SpeedStep technology performs voltage and frequency changes separately so the system performs better with reduced latency due to system unavailability. Thermal Monitoring Technologies This feature is designed to protect the processor in the event of unusual circumstances such as cooling fan failure which can cause damage if internal chassis temperatures become higher than normal. It works by reducing the processor's power consumption if the programmed thermal temperature is exceeded. The processor contains a thermal diode which measures the actual CPU temperature and relays its temperature and thermal requirements to the motherboard. The motherboard uses those requirements to control the processor fan and ensure it does not spin faster than necessary - even under worst case power use. Intel HD Audio Integrated audio technology enables multi-channel playback at a higher quality than earlier integrated audio formats. Intel IPT Identity Protection Technology Designed to provide another layer of online security, Intel IPT  works by partnering with websites to help keep your personal information safe when you log in to your favorite IPT-enabled sites like shopping, bill paying, banking, etc. Intel IPT verifies your log-in, confirms you're using a trusted device, and protects your account from being accessed without your recognized device. Intel AES-NI Advance Encryption Standard New Instructions AES-NI, is an encryption standard used by the U.S. government since 2001 and now is commonly used in software to protect network traffic, personal data, and corporate IT infrastructure. Intel processors use AES in addition to a set of six new instructions to enable hardware to do some of the work of AES, thereby accelerating its execution by three to 10 times compared with relying solely on software. Intel Secure Key Intel Secure Key is a feature designed to keep your data and personal information safe by strengthening encryption capability via a digital random number generator. Execute Disable Bit Reduces your system's exposure to viruses and mal-ware attacks, and the chances of self-executing and propagating software from taking down your system or network. That can save you costly repairs, lost productivity, and revenue. Bluetooth® 4.0 Also known as Bluetooth Smart Ready, it takes wireless communication to a whole new level. First, it's compatible with a large number of devices like tablets, smart phones, and of course computers, but it's also compatible with TV remotes, and even appliances. All of these things will be controlled using apps, so the ability to turn on the lights or your oven before you get home will be as easy as picking up your cellphone. In addition, it uses considerably less power.
