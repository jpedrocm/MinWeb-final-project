Having it (5.9lbs) I knew what I wanted and needed. 128SSD is plenty for me. Got 8MB and Win7. Light. Centered 'pad vs not. Keyboard class act. Can use my old charger too. Silver has HD screen. Back-lit would be only desire but even then not worth any $$ to do it. Have only had for 2 weeks but Y/tube has some critical reviews and CNET just wrote up like July 3rd. Date published: 2016-07-10 Rated 4 out of 5 by fouad from sturdy laptop but graphics could have been better I recommend it for grad students who want a sturdy and durable ultrabook for work-oriented purposes. However, don't expect this ultrabook to be great for gaming or entertainment (movie watching) purposes (to be fair it is alright when it comes to those two activities previously mentioned but not mind-blowing). It is mainly built for productivity and mobility (if you happen to be work on the go). Date published: 2016-06-28 Rated 5 out of 5 by Pam24 from Great for college/work I bought this 2 weeks ago and I love it. I wanted a portable, long lasting laptop for school that is high quality and has great performance, and I got it. For about $600, you get exactly what you need for school and work. However, if you want more of an entertainment/gaming device, you should consider something else because this isn't built for that. Also, before I bought this computer I saw that it had bad reviews about screen/brightness and I was apprehensive as well but I purchase it regardless. Honestly it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I don't really know much about the screens but when I use it indoors in like my living room it looks really good and bright. I haven't tried it outside yet but I feel like it won't be bright enough/too much glare. This doesn't bother me because I typically use my laptops indoors so if this is a big issue for you, I would recommend something else. overall, I think this is a great product for any college student. It's extremely light so I love that since I normally carry a laptop to class everyday. Also the keyboard is superb, I love typing on it. Trackpad kinda sucks to be honest but Im used to the red pointer. Lastly it does not produce noise from the fans. One of my previous laptops had such a loud fan it drove me insane. Overall, love this affordable, yet superior ultrabook Date published: 2016-07-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by Xylonfon from Exellent Laptop! 1080p, solid build, 3x USB 3.0 + (fantastic) A USB-C 3.1 that you also can charge the laptop with! Lenovo, GREAT JOB! I Love it! I write this only because the other reviewers are either kids with spare time, or just someone that complains about something they don't even have in their posession.. Date published: 2016-05-01 Rated 2 out of 5 by cantfindausername from Horrible Elan Trackpad ruins the experience. Great feature sheet for the price. Upgradeable ram and SSD. Fairly light, IPS screen. But...unfortunately, the trackpad on this laptop is horrendous. I have to assume Elan trackpads are cheaper than Synaptics, or any Windows Precision certified touchpads, which is why they included it. Trying to click on anything makes the cursor jump, meaning half the time you miss what you're trying to click. Clicking with a thumb sometimes registers as a two-finger click, popping up a context menu instead of registering a standard click. Two-finger scrolling is laggy. I've spent hours trying different drivers, trying different combinations of trackpad settings, trying Synaptics drivers (!), researching whether I could fool Windows into thinking it's a Precision touchpad, all to no avail. Currently, I've disabled almost all of the Elan touchpad driver "features" just to get a semblance of a working touchpad. If you're going to buy a Windows laptop, do yourself a favor and get one with a Windows Precision touchpad. That includes the XPS 13, which I was cross-shopping with this one, as well as the Inspiron 13. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by abcd345 from PSA: DO NOT BUY - DISPLAY IS ONLY 200 - 220 NITS The display maxes out at 200 nits (220 for the second option) which is laughable. The actual number should be even lower. This screen should be unusable unless you work in complete darkness. Until Lenovo upgrades the screen, stay away from this model. Date published: 2016-04-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by jamcguire19 from Every Feature Exceeded Expectations I bought this laptop for law school with some modification and I could not be more satisfied! The start up time is unbelievable. The screen exceeded my expectations and I do not have any of the problems listed in other reviews. It arrived faster than expected. The quality feels so much more expensive than what I paid. Date published: 2016-08-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alex G from This ultrabook sings! The keyboard and battery life are excellent, and the system is very stable and runs quickly and quietly. For the money, I do not think you can do better in an ultrabook PC. I am very happy with this purchase. Date published: 2016-07-14 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mitch94 from Just what I needed I've had the laptop for about three weeks now, and it is just perfect! I was in need of a new laptop for college, and it fits my needs so much better than my previous laptop. I needed a machine that was lighter, could have more battery life, and had power for the older, specialized programs my courses have been requiring. So far, the Thinkpad 13 feels light in hand and in my backpack, the battery is lasting around a workday as I tested the battery, and performance is great so far. My favorite thing about the laptop so far has been the Thinkpad grade keyboard. It's not just the deeper travel, but the key texture and the cushioned feel is bliss. Some reviews complained that the screen is too dim, but its fine. I could expect issues in direct sunlight, but I don't plan to work on homework on a patio. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by xaniar from best in value i think there are very good advantages like ... 1- best keyboard 2- exelent battery 3- good looking design 4 - enough performance 5 - good value Date published: 2016-05-08 Rated 5 out of 5 by John217 from Great Value Laptop Such a low price for that legendary thinkpad keyboard is very nice to see. Lenovo also throws in a thin chassis, and extremely upgradable parts that are very easy to get to. Kepp in mind, I would rather upgrade them myself, since it is cheaper, but if you do not want to do so, lenovo's upgrades are not too overpriced. Good too see a solid laptop come in at an affordable price. Date published: 2016-05-31 Rated 3 out of 5 by Maine22 from Like the set up Like the set up and features but, have had problems with the key board connecting back to the tablet.Sometimes the connection does not take and I've had to remove it again and reconnect it.Another issue is sometimes if you pick it up and move it while connected to key board the light goes out and you have to move it around again to get the connection back on to use the key board.Other than the connection between the two I have no other complaints. Date published: 2016-08-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by 0Kim0 from Happy with my Thinkpad 13 I bought this a few months ago after my old laptop broke. I'm much happier with this one. It is lightweight, which is great because I have to ride my bike to and from classes. It runs great and I've had no problems so far. For the price, it is a great laptop. It works fine for my programming projects, it starts up fast, and has decent sound and graphics. Date published: 2016-07-28 Rated 4 out of 5 by paleonate from So far so good I purchased this about a month ago and have been very happy with the performance and weight. Main complaints: I miss having more than two USB ports- most of my files on external hard drives or the cloud, and this only has 117GB. It is also sometimes doesn't respond when I click to wake up from sleep. Date published: 2016-06-20 Rated 5 out of 5 by shawn78 from Good Laptop Even though it said it might take upto 3 weeks, I got the laptop in 1 week. Asked for expedited shipping and got the laptop in 5 business days since ordering. After a lot of research I settled on this laptop. It didn't disappoint. Everything is exactly as advertised. Date published: 2016-07-20 Rated 1 out of 5 by BusinessUser from scrap - no buttons below the trackpad There are (again!) no buttons underneath the trackpad. This is a no go for business use! Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 4 out of 5 by Paramedic Jorge from Really good for the price. Paired it with a Logitech MX master mouse... and boom. Very good product. Built well and performs great. I mainly got it so i can upgrade the RAM later and it should very well last me 3 to 5 years. Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Melie from Lovely Laptop I have now owned my Thinkpad for about a month. This little computer goes everywhere with me; it is rather lightweight. It was easy to set up and run. The graphics are very good, too. I bought the laptop for finishing grad school. I also teach, so I type class materials and load them to OneDrive to access when I get to school. I love that I can save directly to OneDrive. Before I had to save the document, open a web browser, go to OneDrive, and then upload the document--this saves me lots of time and memory (I am usually working at really late hours and firget to delete the duplicated file on my computer). In fact, I have become so spoiled that I found myself looking for the option to save a draft for a grad school paper on OneDrive from my job, which does not have that capability. One of the reasons I bought this particular laptop was because the reviews regarding the keyboard were very favorable. I am glad to say the keyboard is very comfortable. I type anywhere from 10-20 pages a week and most of that is on the Thinkpad 13. The keys are comfortable to depress and do not have annoying sounds. I highly recommend this computer. My students at school use an older model of the Thinkpad. After 10 years, the laptops at school are still going strong. I have confidence that my new laptop will still be going strong in 10 years too.

I JUST ORDERED THE tHINKPAD 13 AND IT WAS $611 AS CONFIGURED. Asked by: DELKINS11 I think the reduced price $509.25 for the select configuration was due to Memorial Day discount which continued until June 1st.

Having it (5.9lbs) I knew what I wanted and needed. 128SSD is plenty for me. Got 8MB and Win7. Light. Centered 'pad vs not. Keyboard class act. Can use my old charger too. Silver has HD screen. Back-lit would be only desire but even then not worth any $$ to do it. Have only had for 2 weeks but Y/tube has some critical reviews and CNET just wrote up like July 3rd. Date published: 2016-07-10 Rated 4 out of 5 by fouad from sturdy laptop but graphics could have been better I recommend it for grad students who want a sturdy and durable ultrabook for work-oriented purposes. However, don't expect this ultrabook to be great for gaming or entertainment (movie watching) purposes (to be fair it is alright when it comes to those two activities previously mentioned but not mind-blowing). It is mainly built for productivity and mobility (if you happen to be work on the go). Date published: 2016-06-28 Rated 5 out of 5 by Pam24 from Great for college/work I bought this 2 weeks ago and I love it. I wanted a portable, long lasting laptop for school that is high quality and has great performance, and I got it. For about $600, you get exactly what you need for school and work. However, if you want more of an entertainment/gaming device, you should consider something else because this isn't built for that. Also, before I bought this computer I saw that it had bad reviews about screen/brightness and I was apprehensive as well but I purchase it regardless. Honestly it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I don't really know much about the screens but when I use it indoors in like my living room it looks really good and bright. I haven't tried it outside yet but I feel like it won't be bright enough/too much glare. This doesn't bother me because I typically use my laptops indoors so if this is a big issue for you, I would recommend something else. overall, I think this is a great product for any college student. It's extremely light so I love that since I normally carry a laptop to class everyday. Also the keyboard is superb, I love typing on it. Trackpad kinda sucks to be honest but Im used to the red pointer. Lastly it does not produce noise from the fans. One of my previous laptops had such a loud fan it drove me insane. Overall, love this affordable, yet superior ultrabook Date published: 2016-07-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by Xylonfon from Exellent Laptop! 1080p, solid build, 3x USB 3.0 + (fantastic) A USB-C 3.1 that you also can charge the laptop with! Lenovo, GREAT JOB! I Love it! I write this only because the other reviewers are either kids with spare time, or just someone that complains about something they don't even have in their posession.. Date published: 2016-05-01 Rated 2 out of 5 by cantfindausername from Horrible Elan Trackpad ruins the experience. Great feature sheet for the price. Upgradeable ram and SSD. Fairly light, IPS screen. But...unfortunately, the trackpad on this laptop is horrendous. I have to assume Elan trackpads are cheaper than Synaptics, or any Windows Precision certified touchpads, which is why they included it. Trying to click on anything makes the cursor jump, meaning half the time you miss what you're trying to click. Clicking with a thumb sometimes registers as a two-finger click, popping up a context menu instead of registering a standard click. Two-finger scrolling is laggy. I've spent hours trying different drivers, trying different combinations of trackpad settings, trying Synaptics drivers (!), researching whether I could fool Windows into thinking it's a Precision touchpad, all to no avail. Currently, I've disabled almost all of the Elan touchpad driver "features" just to get a semblance of a working touchpad. If you're going to buy a Windows laptop, do yourself a favor and get one with a Windows Precision touchpad. That includes the XPS 13, which I was cross-shopping with this one, as well as the Inspiron 13. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by abcd345 from PSA: DO NOT BUY - DISPLAY IS ONLY 200 - 220 NITS The display maxes out at 200 nits (220 for the second option) which is laughable. The actual number should be even lower. This screen should be unusable unless you work in complete darkness. Until Lenovo upgrades the screen, stay away from this model. Date published: 2016-04-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by jamcguire19 from Every Feature Exceeded Expectations I bought this laptop for law school with some modification and I could not be more satisfied! The start up time is unbelievable. The screen exceeded my expectations and I do not have any of the problems listed in other reviews. It arrived faster than expected. The quality feels so much more expensive than what I paid. Date published: 2016-08-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alex G from This ultrabook sings! The keyboard and battery life are excellent, and the system is very stable and runs quickly and quietly. For the money, I do not think you can do better in an ultrabook PC. I am very happy with this purchase. Date published: 2016-07-14 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mitch94 from Just what I needed I've had the laptop for about three weeks now, and it is just perfect! I was in need of a new laptop for college, and it fits my needs so much better than my previous laptop. I needed a machine that was lighter, could have more battery life, and had power for the older, specialized programs my courses have been requiring. So far, the Thinkpad 13 feels light in hand and in my backpack, the battery is lasting around a workday as I tested the battery, and performance is great so far. My favorite thing about the laptop so far has been the Thinkpad grade keyboard. It's not just the deeper travel, but the key texture and the cushioned feel is bliss. Some reviews complained that the screen is too dim, but its fine. I could expect issues in direct sunlight, but I don't plan to work on homework on a patio. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by xaniar from best in value i think there are very good advantages like ... 1- best keyboard 2- exelent battery 3- good looking design 4 - enough performance 5 - good value Date published: 2016-05-08 Rated 5 out of 5 by John217 from Great Value Laptop Such a low price for that legendary thinkpad keyboard is very nice to see. Lenovo also throws in a thin chassis, and extremely upgradable parts that are very easy to get to. Kepp in mind, I would rather upgrade them myself, since it is cheaper, but if you do not want to do so, lenovo's upgrades are not too overpriced. Good too see a solid laptop come in at an affordable price. Date published: 2016-05-31 Rated 3 out of 5 by Maine22 from Like the set up Like the set up and features but, have had problems with the key board connecting back to the tablet.Sometimes the connection does not take and I've had to remove it again and reconnect it.Another issue is sometimes if you pick it up and move it while connected to key board the light goes out and you have to move it around again to get the connection back on to use the key board.Other than the connection between the two I have no other complaints. Date published: 2016-08-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by 0Kim0 from Happy with my Thinkpad 13 I bought this a few months ago after my old laptop broke. I'm much happier with this one. It is lightweight, which is great because I have to ride my bike to and from classes. It runs great and I've had no problems so far. For the price, it is a great laptop. It works fine for my programming projects, it starts up fast, and has decent sound and graphics. Date published: 2016-07-28 Rated 4 out of 5 by paleonate from So far so good I purchased this about a month ago and have been very happy with the performance and weight. Main complaints: I miss having more than two USB ports- most of my files on external hard drives or the cloud, and this only has 117GB. It is also sometimes doesn't respond when I click to wake up from sleep. Date published: 2016-06-20 Rated 5 out of 5 by shawn78 from Good Laptop Even though it said it might take upto 3 weeks, I got the laptop in 1 week. Asked for expedited shipping and got the laptop in 5 business days since ordering. After a lot of research I settled on this laptop. It didn't disappoint. Everything is exactly as advertised. Date published: 2016-07-20 Rated 1 out of 5 by BusinessUser from scrap - no buttons below the trackpad There are (again!) no buttons underneath the trackpad. This is a no go for business use! Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 4 out of 5 by Paramedic Jorge from Really good for the price. Paired it with a Logitech MX master mouse... and boom. Very good product. Built well and performs great. I mainly got it so i can upgrade the RAM later and it should very well last me 3 to 5 years. Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Melie from Lovely Laptop I have now owned my Thinkpad for about a month. This little computer goes everywhere with me; it is rather lightweight. It was easy to set up and run. The graphics are very good, too. I bought the laptop for finishing grad school. I also teach, so I type class materials and load them to OneDrive to access when I get to school. I love that I can save directly to OneDrive. Before I had to save the document, open a web browser, go to OneDrive, and then upload the document--this saves me lots of time and memory (I am usually working at really late hours and firget to delete the duplicated file on my computer). In fact, I have become so spoiled that I found myself looking for the option to save a draft for a grad school paper on OneDrive from my job, which does not have that capability. One of the reasons I bought this particular laptop was because the reviews regarding the keyboard were very favorable. I am glad to say the keyboard is very comfortable. I type anywhere from 10-20 pages a week and most of that is on the Thinkpad 13. The keys are comfortable to depress and do not have annoying sounds. I highly recommend this computer. My students at school use an older model of the Thinkpad. After 10 years, the laptops at school are still going strong. I have confidence that my new laptop will still be going strong in 10 years too.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Hack Saw from Very happy Replaced my 2.5yr G580 that did a great job for $349. Having it (5.9lbs) I knew what I wanted and needed. 128SSD is plenty for me. Got 8MB and Win7. Light. Centered 'pad vs not. Keyboard class act. Can use my old charger too. Silver has HD screen. Back-lit would be only desire but even then not worth any $$ to do it. Have only had for 2 weeks but Y/tube has some critical reviews and CNET just wrote up like July 3rd. Date published: 2016-07-10 Rated 4 out of 5 by fouad from sturdy laptop but graphics could have been better I recommend it for grad students who want a sturdy and durable ultrabook for work-oriented purposes. However, don't expect this ultrabook to be great for gaming or entertainment (movie watching) purposes (to be fair it is alright when it comes to those two activities previously mentioned but not mind-blowing). It is mainly built for productivity and mobility (if you happen to be work on the go). Date published: 2016-06-28 Rated 5 out of 5 by Pam24 from Great for college/work I bought this 2 weeks ago and I love it. I wanted a portable, long lasting laptop for school that is high quality and has great performance, and I got it. For about $600, you get exactly what you need for school and work. However, if you want more of an entertainment/gaming device, you should consider something else because this isn't built for that. Also, before I bought this computer I saw that it had bad reviews about screen/brightness and I was apprehensive as well but I purchase it regardless. Honestly it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I don't really know much about the screens but when I use it indoors in like my living room it looks really good and bright. I haven't tried it outside yet but I feel like it won't be bright enough/too much glare. This doesn't bother me because I typically use my laptops indoors so if this is a big issue for you, I would recommend something else. overall, I think this is a great product for any college student. It's extremely light so I love that since I normally carry a laptop to class everyday. Also the keyboard is superb, I love typing on it. Trackpad kinda sucks to be honest but Im used to the red pointer. Lastly it does not produce noise from the fans. One of my previous laptops had such a loud fan it drove me insane. Overall, love this affordable, yet superior ultrabook Date published: 2016-07-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by Xylonfon from Exellent Laptop! 1080p, solid build, 3x USB 3.0 + (fantastic) A USB-C 3.1 that you also can charge the laptop with! Lenovo, GREAT JOB! I Love it! I write this only because the other reviewers are either kids with spare time, or just someone that complains about something they don't even have in their posession.. Date published: 2016-05-01 Rated 2 out of 5 by cantfindausername from Horrible Elan Trackpad ruins the experience. Great feature sheet for the price. Upgradeable ram and SSD. Fairly light, IPS screen. But...unfortunately, the trackpad on this laptop is horrendous. I have to assume Elan trackpads are cheaper than Synaptics, or any Windows Precision certified touchpads, which is why they included it. Trying to click on anything makes the cursor jump, meaning half the time you miss what you're trying to click. Clicking with a thumb sometimes registers as a two-finger click, popping up a context menu instead of registering a standard click. Two-finger scrolling is laggy. I've spent hours trying different drivers, trying different combinations of trackpad settings, trying Synaptics drivers (!), researching whether I could fool Windows into thinking it's a Precision touchpad, all to no avail. Currently, I've disabled almost all of the Elan touchpad driver "features" just to get a semblance of a working touchpad. If you're going to buy a Windows laptop, do yourself a favor and get one with a Windows Precision touchpad. That includes the XPS 13, which I was cross-shopping with this one, as well as the Inspiron 13. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by abcd345 from PSA: DO NOT BUY - DISPLAY IS ONLY 200 - 220 NITS The display maxes out at 200 nits (220 for the second option) which is laughable. The actual number should be even lower. This screen should be unusable unless you work in complete darkness. Until Lenovo upgrades the screen, stay away from this model. Date published: 2016-04-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by jamcguire19 from Every Feature Exceeded Expectations I bought this laptop for law school with some modification and I could not be more satisfied! The start up time is unbelievable. The screen exceeded my expectations and I do not have any of the problems listed in other reviews. It arrived faster than expected. The quality feels so much more expensive than what I paid. Date published: 2016-08-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by Alex G from This ultrabook sings! The keyboard and battery life are excellent, and the system is very stable and runs quickly and quietly. For the money, I do not think you can do better in an ultrabook PC. I am very happy with this purchase. Date published: 2016-07-14 Rated 5 out of 5 by Mitch94 from Just what I needed I've had the laptop for about three weeks now, and it is just perfect! I was in need of a new laptop for college, and it fits my needs so much better than my previous laptop. I needed a machine that was lighter, could have more battery life, and had power for the older, specialized programs my courses have been requiring. So far, the Thinkpad 13 feels light in hand and in my backpack, the battery is lasting around a workday as I tested the battery, and performance is great so far. My favorite thing about the laptop so far has been the Thinkpad grade keyboard. It's not just the deeper travel, but the key texture and the cushioned feel is bliss. Some reviews complained that the screen is too dim, but its fine. I could expect issues in direct sunlight, but I don't plan to work on homework on a patio. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by xaniar from best in value i think there are very good advantages like ... 1- best keyboard 2- exelent battery 3- good looking design 4 - enough performance 5 - good value Date published: 2016-05-08 Rated 5 out of 5 by John217 from Great Value Laptop Such a low price for that legendary thinkpad keyboard is very nice to see. Lenovo also throws in a thin chassis, and extremely upgradable parts that are very easy to get to. Kepp in mind, I would rather upgrade them myself, since it is cheaper, but if you do not want to do so, lenovo's upgrades are not too overpriced. Good too see a solid laptop come in at an affordable price. Date published: 2016-05-31 Rated 3 out of 5 by Maine22 from Like the set up Like the set up and features but, have had problems with the key board connecting back to the tablet.Sometimes the connection does not take and I've had to remove it again and reconnect it.Another issue is sometimes if you pick it up and move it while connected to key board the light goes out and you have to move it around again to get the connection back on to use the key board.Other than the connection between the two I have no other complaints. Date published: 2016-08-01 Rated 5 out of 5 by 0Kim0 from Happy with my Thinkpad 13 I bought this a few months ago after my old laptop broke. I'm much happier with this one. It is lightweight, which is great because I have to ride my bike to and from classes. It runs great and I've had no problems so far. For the price, it is a great laptop. It works fine for my programming projects, it starts up fast, and has decent sound and graphics. Date published: 2016-07-28 Rated 4 out of 5 by paleonate from So far so good I purchased this about a month ago and have been very happy with the performance and weight. Main complaints: I miss having more than two USB ports- most of my files on external hard drives or the cloud, and this only has 117GB. It is also sometimes doesn't respond when I click to wake up from sleep. Date published: 2016-06-20 Rated 5 out of 5 by shawn78 from Good Laptop Even though it said it might take upto 3 weeks, I got the laptop in 1 week. Asked for expedited shipping and got the laptop in 5 business days since ordering. After a lot of research I settled on this laptop. It didn't disappoint. Everything is exactly as advertised. Date published: 2016-07-20 Rated 1 out of 5 by BusinessUser from scrap - no buttons below the trackpad There are (again!) no buttons underneath the trackpad. This is a no go for business use! Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 4 out of 5 by Paramedic Jorge from Really good for the price. Paired it with a Logitech MX master mouse... and boom. Very good product. Built well and performs great. I mainly got it so i can upgrade the RAM later and it should very well last me 3 to 5 years. Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Melie from Lovely Laptop I have now owned my Thinkpad for about a month. This little computer goes everywhere with me; it is rather lightweight. It was easy to set up and run. The graphics are very good, too. I bought the laptop for finishing grad school. I also teach, so I type class materials and load them to OneDrive to access when I get to school. I love that I can save directly to OneDrive. Before I had to save the document, open a web browser, go to OneDrive, and then upload the document--this saves me lots of time and memory (I am usually working at really late hours and firget to delete the duplicated file on my computer). In fact, I have become so spoiled that I found myself looking for the option to save a draft for a grad school paper on OneDrive from my job, which does not have that capability. One of the reasons I bought this particular laptop was because the reviews regarding the keyboard were very favorable. I am glad to say the keyboard is very comfortable. I type anywhere from 10-20 pages a week and most of that is on the Thinkpad 13. The keys are comfortable to depress and do not have annoying sounds. I highly recommend this computer. My students at school use an older model of the Thinkpad. After 10 years, the laptops at school are still going strong. I have confidence that my new laptop will still be going strong in 10 years too.

Main complaints: I miss having more than two USB ports- most of my files on external hard drives or the cloud, and this only has 117GB. It is also sometimes doesn't respond when I click to wake up from sleep.

Date published: 2016-07-24 Rated 5 out of 5 by Melie from Lovely Laptop I have now owned my Thinkpad for about a month. This little computer goes everywhere with me; it is rather lightweight. It was easy to set up and run. The graphics are very good, too. I bought the laptop for finishing grad school. I also teach, so I type class materials and load them to OneDrive to access when I get to school. I love that I can save directly to OneDrive. Before I had to save the document, open a web browser, go to OneDrive, and then upload the document--this saves me lots of time and memory (I am usually working at really late hours and firget to delete the duplicated file on my computer). In fact, I have become so spoiled that I found myself looking for the option to save a draft for a grad school paper on OneDrive from my job, which does not have that capability. One of the reasons I bought this particular laptop was because the reviews regarding the keyboard were very favorable. I am glad to say the keyboard is very comfortable. I type anywhere from 10-20 pages a week and most of that is on the Thinkpad 13. The keys are comfortable to depress and do not have annoying sounds. I highly recommend this computer. My students at school use an older model of the Thinkpad. After 10 years, the laptops at school are still going strong. I have confidence that my new laptop will still be going strong in 10 years too. Date published: 2016-09-12
Rated 5 out of 5 by Hack Saw from Very happy Replaced my 2.5yr G580 that did a great job for $349. Having it (5.9lbs) I knew what I wanted and needed. 128SSD is plenty for me. Got 8MB and Win7. Light. Centered 'pad vs not. Keyboard class act. Can use my old charger too. Silver has HD screen. Back-lit would be only desire but even then not worth any $$ to do it. Have only had for 2 weeks but Y/tube has some critical reviews and CNET just wrote up like July 3rd. Date published: 2016-07-10

Rated 4 out of 5 by fouad from sturdy laptop but graphics could have been better I recommend it for grad students who want a sturdy and durable ultrabook for work-oriented purposes. However, don't expect this ultrabook to be great for gaming or entertainment (movie watching) purposes (to be fair it is alright when it comes to those two activities previously mentioned but not mind-blowing). It is mainly built for productivity and mobility (if you happen to be work on the go). Date published: 2016-06-28

Rated 5 out of 5 by Pam24 from Great for college/work I bought this 2 weeks ago and I love it. I wanted a portable, long lasting laptop for school that is high quality and has great performance, and I got it. For about $600, you get exactly what you need for school and work. However, if you want more of an entertainment/gaming device, you should consider something else because this isn't built for that. Also, before I bought this computer I saw that it had bad reviews about screen/brightness and I was apprehensive as well but I purchase it regardless. Honestly it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I don't really know much about the screens but when I use it indoors in like my living room it looks really good and bright. I haven't tried it outside yet but I feel like it won't be bright enough/too much glare. This doesn't bother me because I typically use my laptops indoors so if this is a big issue for you, I would recommend something else. overall, I think this is a great product for any college student. It's extremely light so I love that since I normally carry a laptop to class everyday. Also the keyboard is superb, I love typing on it. Trackpad kinda sucks to be honest but Im used to the red pointer. Lastly it does not produce noise from the fans. One of my previous laptops had such a loud fan it drove me insane. Overall, love this affordable, yet superior ultrabook Date published: 2016-07-09

Rated 2 out of 5 by cantfindausername from Horrible Elan Trackpad ruins the experience. Great feature sheet for the price. Upgradeable ram and SSD. Fairly light, IPS screen. But...unfortunately, the trackpad on this laptop is horrendous. I have to assume Elan trackpads are cheaper than Synaptics, or any Windows Precision certified touchpads, which is why they included it. Trying to click on anything makes the cursor jump, meaning half the time you miss what you're trying to click. Clicking with a thumb sometimes registers as a two-finger click, popping up a context menu instead of registering a standard click. Two-finger scrolling is laggy. I've spent hours trying different drivers, trying different combinations of trackpad settings, trying Synaptics drivers (!), researching whether I could fool Windows into thinking it's a Precision touchpad, all to no avail. Currently, I've disabled almost all of the Elan touchpad driver "features" just to get a semblance of a working touchpad. If you're going to buy a Windows laptop, do yourself a favor and get one with a Windows Precision touchpad. That includes the XPS 13, which I was cross-shopping with this one, as well as the Inspiron 13. Date published: 2016-08-15

Rated 5 out of 5 by Mitch94 from Just what I needed I've had the laptop for about three weeks now, and it is just perfect! I was in need of a new laptop for college, and it fits my needs so much better than my previous laptop. I needed a machine that was lighter, could have more battery life, and had power for the older, specialized programs my courses have been requiring. So far, the Thinkpad 13 feels light in hand and in my backpack, the battery is lasting around a workday as I tested the battery, and performance is great so far. My favorite thing about the laptop so far has been the Thinkpad grade keyboard. It's not just the deeper travel, but the key texture and the cushioned feel is bliss. Some reviews complained that the screen is too dim, but its fine. I could expect issues in direct sunlight, but I don't plan to work on homework on a patio. Date published: 2016-08-15

Good too see a solid laptop come in at an affordable price. Date published: 2016-05-31
