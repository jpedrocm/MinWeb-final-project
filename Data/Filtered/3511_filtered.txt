Everything was easy to set up and the interface is great when you learn how to use it. The only problem was the camera not working for anything, so I had to roll back the driver software. An easy fix, but a problem still.

It still has some glitches, but overall it works well. One time when using the screen separately the pen/finger input stopped and there was no way to give input but to re-attach it to the keyboard, but that's minor. Almost all my problems have been with software. Both outlook and the Edge browser have trouble finding the internet connection. I had to download another browser in order to use the internet. Some people complained that the book doesn't close flat but that's no problem at all for me. The screen's super high resolution is terrific although some older software is small on the screen. I wish there were a key combination to toggle back and forth to lower resolution when using these old apps.

I sometimes need to connect to Ethernet networks at other offices. I have had the Surface Book for a week now and my feelings are mixed. I love the size, weight and general build quality. I have worked through many of the quirks such as lower screen resolution to permit me to use multiple monitors and getting IE to work with some websites, but a few remain. IE is takes about 30 seconds to load when I am off the domain (but Edge is fast) and I often have to wait for applications to update. I have blue screened twice while running a virtual machine. The docking station had to be restarted once. I think that it needs a firmware update and some driver updates to be more stable. I would like an Ethernet port to permit me to connect to domains at other offices. I have 8 GB of RAM I would need to move to 16 GB but can't - not totally sold on the closed architecture.

It still has some glitches, but overall it works well. One time when using the screen separately the pen/finger input stopped and there was no way to give input but to re-attach it to the keyboard, but that's minor. Almost all my problems have been with software. Both outlook and the Edge browser have trouble finding the internet connection. I had to download another browser in order to use the internet. Some people complained that the book doesn't close flat but that's no problem at all for me. The screen's super high resolution is terrific although some older software is small on the screen. I wish there were a key combination to toggle back and forth to lower resolution when using these old apps. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (6 of 8 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 12/8/2015 (0 of 1 customers found this review helpful)   4.0 Great form factor By Brian1234 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I am a heavy work user, running business applications and sometimes virtual machines. I sometimes need to connect to Ethernet networks at other offices. I have had the Surface Book for a week now and my feelings are mixed. I love the size, weight and general build quality. I have worked through many of the quirks such as lower screen resolution to permit me to use multiple monitors and getting IE to work with some websites, but a few remain. IE is takes about 30 seconds to load when I am off the domain (but Edge is fast) and I often have to wait for applications to update. I have blue screened twice while running a virtual machine. The docking station had to be restarted once. I think that it needs a firmware update and some driver updates to be more stable. I would like an Ethernet port to permit me to connect to domains at other offices. I have 8 GB of RAM I would need to move to 16 GB but can't - not totally sold on the closed architecture. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (0 of 1 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review Displaying reviews 1-9 Back to top

It still has some glitches, but overall it works well. One time when using the screen separately the pen/finger input stopped and there was no way to give input but to re-attach it to the keyboard, but that's minor. Almost all my problems have been with software. Both outlook and the Edge browser have trouble finding the internet connection. I had to download another browser in order to use the internet. Some people complained that the book doesn't close flat but that's no problem at all for me. The screen's super high resolution is terrific although some older software is small on the screen. I wish there were a key combination to toggle back and forth to lower resolution when using these old apps.

I sometimes need to connect to Ethernet networks at other offices. I have had the Surface Book for a week now and my feelings are mixed. I love the size, weight and general build quality. I have worked through many of the quirks such as lower screen resolution to permit me to use multiple monitors and getting IE to work with some websites, but a few remain. IE is takes about 30 seconds to load when I am off the domain (but Edge is fast) and I often have to wait for applications to update. I have blue screened twice while running a virtual machine. The docking station had to be restarted once. I think that it needs a firmware update and some driver updates to be more stable. I would like an Ethernet port to permit me to connect to domains at other offices. I have 8 GB of RAM I would need to move to 16 GB but can't - not totally sold on the closed architecture.

Product Overview? Back to Top The silver Microsoft SX3-00001 13.5" Surface Book Multi-Touch 2-in-1 Notebook is a high-performance laptop/tablet hybrid with power and versatility. The Surface Book packs an Intel 6th gen (Skylake) dual-core processor into a magnesium casing with a silver finish. Use the tactile keyboard and touchpad to stay productive. You can also detach the screen from the dock and use the Surface Book as a tablet. The included Surface Pen provides added precision thanks to its 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. With a 13.5" PixelSense display, the Surface Book features a 3000 x 2000 screen resolution (267 ppi) and a 3:2 aspect ratio. The display is also a 10-point touch support so you can take full advantage of the multi-touch gestures incorporated into Windows 10 Pro. If you want to output video to an external display, you can use the mini DisplayPort. The system is powered by a dual-core 6th generation (Skylake) 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5-6300U processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics 520. The Surface Book also has a dedicated NVIDIA GPU embedded into the keyboard. When the screen is detached, only the integrated graphics chip can be utilized. It also has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB solid state drive, an SD media card slot, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, a 5MP front-facing camera, an 8MP rear-facing camera with autofocus and 1080p HD video recording, and dual integrated microphones. There are also built-in front-facing stereo speakers with Dolby audio. Windows 10 Pro is the installed operating system.

I have worked through many of the quirks such as lower screen resolution to permit me to use multiple monitors and getting IE to work with some websites, but a few remain. IE is takes about 30 seconds to load when I am off the domain (but Edge is fast) and I often have to wait for applications to update. I have blue screened twice while running a virtual machine. The docking station had to be restarted once. I think that it needs a firmware update and some driver updates to be more stable. I would like an Ethernet port to permit me to connect to domains at other offices. I have 8 GB of RAM I would need to move to 16 GB but can't - not totally sold on the closed architecture.

12/24/2015 (6 of 8 customers found this review helpful)   4.0 Some really nice features By DanIsTooShortANameDuh from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: After a week I still like the surface book a lot. It still has some glitches, but overall it works well. One time when using the screen separately the pen/finger input stopped and there was no way to give input but to re-attach it to the keyboard, but that's minor. Almost all my problems have been with software. Both outlook and the Edge browser have trouble finding the internet connection. I had to download another browser in order to use the internet. Some people complained that the book doesn't close flat but that's no problem at all for me. The screen's super high resolution is terrific although some older software is small on the screen. I wish there were a key combination to toggle back and forth to lower resolution when using these old apps.

One time when using the screen separately the pen/finger input stopped and there was no way to give input but to re-attach it to the keyboard, but that's minor. Almost all my problems have been with software. Both outlook and the Edge browser have trouble finding the internet connection. I had to download another browser in order to use the internet. Some people complained that the book doesn't close flat but that's no problem at all for me. The screen's super high resolution is terrific although some older software is small on the screen. I wish there were a key combination to toggle back and forth to lower resolution when using these old apps.

12/8/2015 (0 of 1 customers found this review helpful)   4.0 Great form factor By Brian1234 from Undisclosed Comments about Microsoft 13.5" Intel Surface Book 2-In-1 Laptop Computer: I am a heavy work user, running business applications and sometimes virtual machines. I sometimes need to connect to Ethernet networks at other offices. I have had the Surface Book for a week now and my feelings are mixed. I love the size, weight and general build quality. I have worked through many of the quirks such as lower screen resolution to permit me to use multiple monitors and getting IE to work with some websites, but a few remain. IE is takes about 30 seconds to load when I am off the domain (but Edge is fast) and I often have to wait for applications to update. I have blue screened twice while running a virtual machine. The docking station had to be restarted once. I think that it needs a firmware update and some driver updates to be more stable. I would like an Ethernet port to permit me to connect to domains at other offices. I have 8 GB of RAM I would need to move to 16 GB but can't - not totally sold on the closed architecture.
