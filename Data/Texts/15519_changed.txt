It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Laptop performance, tablet portability The Microsoft Surface 3 features the same Windows operating system as your laptop or desktop, meaning you can use full versions of your favourite software wherever you are. From typing up documents with Office to tweaking images with Photoshop Elements, whatever you do on your PC you can do it on the Surface 3. Plus you can use the Surface 3 all day between charges thanks to the 10 hour battery. Premium design Wherever you are, the Surface 3 fits in thanks to its high-quality magnesium body. It's impressively light and thin, so won't weigh down your bag like a laptop can. An integrated kickstand allows you to place the Surface 3 on any flat surface so you can watch films and entertainment completely hands free. Whatever you're watching, you can expect beautiful image quality thanks to the 10.8” Full HD screen. With a higher resolution than many TVs, you won't be compromising on image quality.  Complete connectivity A full-size USB port makes connecting peripherals simple. From a wireless mouse and keyboard to a soundcard or graphics tablet, you can connect your devices with ease. It works with external storage, so backing up important documents is simple. Viewing your content on a monitor is easy too - just connect the Surface 3 to a monitor or TV using the Mini-DisplayPort. Pre-installed with Windows 10 If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, while everyone will benefit from the many new and exciting features designed to make accessing what matters to you quick and easy. Windows 10 features the new Edge browser, which gives you a much bigger viewing area for enjoying your online content at its best. You can write notes directly onto web pages and share them with anyone - perfect for students or business. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Whatever you're doing, Windows 10 makes your PC work the way you want. Don't compromise on connectivity and performance. Take tablet computing further with the Microsoft Surface 3. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security.
