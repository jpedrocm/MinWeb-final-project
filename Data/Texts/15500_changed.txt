Inside, the backlit keyboard is reinforced to withstand years of intense gameplay while copper heatpipes and advanced cooling keep it running smoothly during the longest sessions. You can rely the Alienware R3 to last no matter where or how often you game. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M graphics Whether you want to play the latest triple-A titles or the most popular MOBAs, you can experience the biggest and most popular games with incredible detail and super-smooth gameplay. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M graphics card gives you the power to turn the graphics settings up to the maximum on many games available today - you'll see over 60 FPS on Battlefield 4 at Ultra settings, and well over 150 FPS on League of Legends. If you're exploring the wealth of must-play PC classics, such as Half-Life 2 or Fallout, you can comfortably turn all of the graphics settings right up and play them at their best. Whatever you love to play, you won't compromise on performance when you're gaming on the go.

SSD storage Alongside the large-capacity 1 TB hard drive the R3 17 has a 256 GB solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs operate much faster than normal hard drives, so any game stored on it will benefit from reduced loading times - great for large open world game like Skyrim. You can even install Windows 10 to it allow your laptop to boot up in seconds so you're not waiting around when you want to game. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Inside, the backlit keyboard is reinforced to withstand years of intense gameplay while copper heatpipes and advanced cooling keep it running smoothly during the longest sessions. You can rely the Alienware R3 to last no matter where or how often you game. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M graphics Whether you want to play the latest triple-A titles or the most popular MOBAs, you can experience the biggest and most popular games with incredible detail and super-smooth gameplay. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M graphics card gives you the power to turn the graphics settings up to the maximum on many games available today - you'll see over 60 FPS on Battlefield 4 at Ultra settings, and well over 150 FPS on League of Legends. If you're exploring the wealth of must-play PC classics, such as Half-Life 2 or Fallout, you can comfortably turn all of the graphics settings right up and play them at their best. Whatever you love to play, you won't compromise on performance when you're gaming on the go. The latest Intel® Core™ i7 Processing An Intel® Core™i7 processor keeps games, software, and everything else running smoothly. It features a high clock speed and quad-core architecture which stops the processor from holding the graphics card back for consistently fluid gameplay that won't break your concentration. SSD storage Alongside the large-capacity 1 TB hard drive the R3 17 has a 256 GB solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs operate much faster than normal hard drives, so any game stored on it will benefit from reduced loading times - great for large open world game like Skyrim. You can even install Windows 10 to it allow your laptop to boot up in seconds so you're not waiting around when you want to game. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
