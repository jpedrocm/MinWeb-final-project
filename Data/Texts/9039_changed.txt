Instantly had a battery issue! Non-lenovo battery detected (it was the one that came in the box). They've had battery recalls in the past. I asked the technical support rep if she encountered this before and she said "Yes with other models" so she volunteered that information and now I don't feel comfortable buying a T560 either. Didn't try to help, customer service didn't try and help keep me as a customer either. ALSO THE TRACKPAD is horrible, the clicking is above the trackpad so you have to either twist your fingers or use both hands. I was so excited for a great fully loaded thinkpad but product and service was lacking Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 5 out of 5 by PhotoAvalanche from Best Portable Workstation - With Some Issues First off, the product description is limited, use this for real info: https://www.lenovo.com/psref/pdf/ThinkPad.pdf P50s is p.149 If what you are looking for is a high-performance laptop that you can take into the field all day without worrying about battery life and exposure to elements - look no further - especially if you are a photographer, explorer, traveler, champion. I spent roughly 5 straight weeks furiously analyzing the best laptop for my needs(I have a ridiculousl spreadsheet of comparisons). What I wanted: -High-res Display (at least 2880x1620) with Outdoor Brightness -i7 Skylake CPU -8+hrs Battery Life (at least enough to get through all 3 Mel Gibson Mad Max films) -Excellent Keyboard -Durability -Highly-Responsive Touchpad -Relatively Portable (not a 6in thick, 50lb beast that needs a trailer and hitch) Ability to Dock and Run: >4k Monitor >Graphics Accessories (wacom intuos pro, external storage, speakers, etc.) This laptop does all of these with ease with only a couple issues. The Good: -Yes, it has an i7 Skylake and can run a 4k and other gear from a dock - I chose the 90W Ultra Dock. -Display has excellent resolution, viewing angles, and light distribution - I chose the 3K, great for long periods of reading and for looking at thumbnails in Lightroom CC -Battery life is unreal, I got the biggest battery and it was hands down worth the cost, I can work non-stop for at least 8hrs using demanding programs. -Keyboard is the best on the market - excellent travel and nifty shortcuts. Not to mention the signature trackpoint. Also spill proof which is great. -Extremely portable - amazing weight for the hardware. The largest battery sticks up from the bottom slightly - maybe a 1/2-3/4". It sports it's own rubber feet. At first this concerned me, but now I can't imagine living without it, the slight angle of difference it ads improves typing experience, not to mention that when you close the laptop it gives something to gripwith one hand - I do this all the time and it feels good like palming a basketball. -Ultra dock is great, but I have had difficulties with the Display Port - but this could be a software issue. The Bad: - Brightness: On the pdf I linked above Lenovo states the brightness of the 3K screen is 350nits - a big reason I purchased this laptop. I often work outside and need that brightness. I can say one thing with certainty: this screen is NOT 350 nits. Side by side with a 2013 laptop (Lenovo blocks reviews that have competitor's names so I'll just say it's the kind that features half eaten fruit for a logo) and it's NOT AS BRIGHT as the other. The 2013 laptop has a max brightness of about 250 nits, which means lenovo's screen is ONE THIRD less bright than promised. This makes a big difference when working outdoors. I have been able to get by on overcast days, but when it's sunny, even if I'm in the shade, it makes viewing extremely difficult. - Touchpad: First of all, I don't really mind the offset touchpad, I was concerned after all the negative reviews but it doesn't bother me even when I'm using it on my chest lying on the couch. That being said, there are other issues. I expected better from a thinkpad - my touchpad has very high friction - so much it feels textured compared to other laptops I own. I also have a lot of issues with responsiveness - moments when it flat out doesn't respond for a fraction of a second, this may not sound like much, but it means a frozen cursor multiple times a day, photos being dropped into the wrong folder, and other very frustrating inconveniences. If it weren't for the other great features I would have returned it for this reason, but I hold out hope these glitches will be fixed by a driver update. - External Monitor: It runs an external 4k or UHD monitor at 30HZ via HDMI but I have have yet to get it to function using the Display Port on the 90W Ultra Dock - if I do manage to use a monitor through the DP using the Integrated Intel 520 Graphics then it should work at 60HZ. Support: I have had a terrible time with Lenovo tech support, perhaps because this is a newer model they are not yet accustomed to, but every time I have needed help taking it apart or with the external monitor I have to wait while they look up each component and read to me from PDF's I've already read. Not helpful. I spent many countless hours researching laptops and despite some frustrations this is still my favorite. Use it every day. Date published: 2016-04-29 Rated 4 out of 5 by tyty from Overal satisifed. Pros • Startup is very fast (about 10 seconds), largely due to the SSD • Heat is very low; fan is only running when playing game or streaming • Off center Keyboard is fine for me • Keyboard backlight is fancy but still miss the old “thinkpad light” • Speaker is much better than T530; louder and heavier • Light weight as a 15 inches pc • Like the 15 inches screen; way better than T460 Cons • No memory slot at the back of laptop; guess need to take off the keyboard to update the memory • First-time battery charging took very long; also, it takes turn to charge the two batteries instead of charging two at the same time; battery is produced in japan and assembly in china and it is very small and light • The trackpoint is temporarily freezing (few seconds) when the CPU is 100% Date published: 2016-03-29 W700 Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:26CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_18 loc_en_US, sid_F112727048C6688C2BC5D5350E7FA47B_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo Is there a similar 15 inch model with the track pad more centered? Asked by: scooter72 No, Lenovo has stopped making 15-inch laptops with centered keyboards. This is a huge problem that many Lenovo customers are having. To those who say "the trackpoint is in the right place because it's in the middle of the keyboard area", you are not listening to the problem. THE KEYBOARD ITSELF SHOULD BE CENTERED, THEN THE TRACKPOINT WOULD BE CENTERED. THEY TRACKPOINT IS IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE THE WHOLE KEYBOARD IS IN THE WRONG PLACE. IF YOU WANT A NUMPAD FINE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR A CENTERED KEYBOARD WITH A CENTERED TRACKPOINT AND NO NUMPAD. Answered by: centeredkeyboardplease Date published: 2016-08-16 Is there a power button on the side so that I don't have to open the display screen every time In need to turn on the laptop when I'm connected to an external display? Asked by: bryguy There is not a power button on the side of the ThinkPad P50s. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-07-19 Is the processor HQ--> quad core Asked by: sandeepp No, it is NOT a quad core. It has a 6x00U processor, which is an Ultrabook processor.

Instantly had a battery issue! Non-lenovo battery detected (it was the one that came in the box). They've had battery recalls in the past. I asked the technical support rep if she encountered this before and she said "Yes with other models" so she volunteered that information and now I don't feel comfortable buying a T560 either. Didn't try to help, customer service didn't try and help keep me as a customer either. ALSO THE TRACKPAD is horrible, the clicking is above the trackpad so you have to either twist your fingers or use both hands. I was so excited for a great fully loaded thinkpad but product and service was lacking Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 5 out of 5 by PhotoAvalanche from Best Portable Workstation - With Some Issues First off, the product description is limited, use this for real info: https://www.lenovo.com/psref/pdf/ThinkPad.pdf P50s is p.149 If what you are looking for is a high-performance laptop that you can take into the field all day without worrying about battery life and exposure to elements - look no further - especially if you are a photographer, explorer, traveler, champion. I spent roughly 5 straight weeks furiously analyzing the best laptop for my needs(I have a ridiculousl spreadsheet of comparisons). What I wanted: -High-res Display (at least 2880x1620) with Outdoor Brightness -i7 Skylake CPU -8+hrs Battery Life (at least enough to get through all 3 Mel Gibson Mad Max films) -Excellent Keyboard -Durability -Highly-Responsive Touchpad -Relatively Portable (not a 6in thick, 50lb beast that needs a trailer and hitch) Ability to Dock and Run: >4k Monitor >Graphics Accessories (wacom intuos pro, external storage, speakers, etc.) This laptop does all of these with ease with only a couple issues. The Good: -Yes, it has an i7 Skylake and can run a 4k and other gear from a dock - I chose the 90W Ultra Dock. -Display has excellent resolution, viewing angles, and light distribution - I chose the 3K, great for long periods of reading and for looking at thumbnails in Lightroom CC -Battery life is unreal, I got the biggest battery and it was hands down worth the cost, I can work non-stop for at least 8hrs using demanding programs. -Keyboard is the best on the market - excellent travel and nifty shortcuts. Not to mention the signature trackpoint. Also spill proof which is great. -Extremely portable - amazing weight for the hardware. The largest battery sticks up from the bottom slightly - maybe a 1/2-3/4". It sports it's own rubber feet. At first this concerned me, but now I can't imagine living without it, the slight angle of difference it ads improves typing experience, not to mention that when you close the laptop it gives something to gripwith one hand - I do this all the time and it feels good like palming a basketball. -Ultra dock is great, but I have had difficulties with the Display Port - but this could be a software issue. The Bad: - Brightness: On the pdf I linked above Lenovo states the brightness of the 3K screen is 350nits - a big reason I purchased this laptop. I often work outside and need that brightness. I can say one thing with certainty: this screen is NOT 350 nits. Side by side with a 2013 laptop (Lenovo blocks reviews that have competitor's names so I'll just say it's the kind that features half eaten fruit for a logo) and it's NOT AS BRIGHT as the other. The 2013 laptop has a max brightness of about 250 nits, which means lenovo's screen is ONE THIRD less bright than promised. This makes a big difference when working outdoors. I have been able to get by on overcast days, but when it's sunny, even if I'm in the shade, it makes viewing extremely difficult. - Touchpad: First of all, I don't really mind the offset touchpad, I was concerned after all the negative reviews but it doesn't bother me even when I'm using it on my chest lying on the couch. That being said, there are other issues. I expected better from a thinkpad - my touchpad has very high friction - so much it feels textured compared to other laptops I own. I also have a lot of issues with responsiveness - moments when it flat out doesn't respond for a fraction of a second, this may not sound like much, but it means a frozen cursor multiple times a day, photos being dropped into the wrong folder, and other very frustrating inconveniences. If it weren't for the other great features I would have returned it for this reason, but I hold out hope these glitches will be fixed by a driver update. - External Monitor: It runs an external 4k or UHD monitor at 30HZ via HDMI but I have have yet to get it to function using the Display Port on the 90W Ultra Dock - if I do manage to use a monitor through the DP using the Integrated Intel 520 Graphics then it should work at 60HZ. Support: I have had a terrible time with Lenovo tech support, perhaps because this is a newer model they are not yet accustomed to, but every time I have needed help taking it apart or with the external monitor I have to wait while they look up each component and read to me from PDF's I've already read. Not helpful. I spent many countless hours researching laptops and despite some frustrations this is still my favorite. Use it every day. Date published: 2016-04-29 Rated 4 out of 5 by tyty from Overal satisifed. Pros • Startup is very fast (about 10 seconds), largely due to the SSD • Heat is very low; fan is only running when playing game or streaming • Off center Keyboard is fine for me • Keyboard backlight is fancy but still miss the old “thinkpad light” • Speaker is much better than T530; louder and heavier • Light weight as a 15 inches pc • Like the 15 inches screen; way better than T460 Cons • No memory slot at the back of laptop; guess need to take off the keyboard to update the memory • First-time battery charging took very long; also, it takes turn to charge the two batteries instead of charging two at the same time; battery is produced in japan and assembly in china and it is very small and light • The trackpoint is temporarily freezing (few seconds) when the CPU is 100% Date published: 2016-03-29 W700 Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:26CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_18 loc_en_US, sid_F112727048C6688C2BC5D5350E7FA47B_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo Is there a similar 15 inch model with the track pad more centered? Asked by: scooter72 No, Lenovo has stopped making 15-inch laptops with centered keyboards. This is a huge problem that many Lenovo customers are having. To those who say "the trackpoint is in the right place because it's in the middle of the keyboard area", you are not listening to the problem. THE KEYBOARD ITSELF SHOULD BE CENTERED, THEN THE TRACKPOINT WOULD BE CENTERED. THEY TRACKPOINT IS IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE THE WHOLE KEYBOARD IS IN THE WRONG PLACE. IF YOU WANT A NUMPAD FINE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR A CENTERED KEYBOARD WITH A CENTERED TRACKPOINT AND NO NUMPAD. Answered by: centeredkeyboardplease Date published: 2016-08-16 Is there a power button on the side so that I don't have to open the display screen every time In need to turn on the laptop when I'm connected to an external display? Asked by: bryguy There is not a power button on the side of the ThinkPad P50s. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-07-19 Is the processor HQ--> quad core Asked by: sandeepp No, it is NOT a quad core. It has a 6x00U processor, which is an Ultrabook processor. If it was a quad core I would own one by now.

Rated 1 out of 5 by Firsttimelasttime from Battery Issue out the box! Instantly had a battery issue! Non-lenovo battery detected (it was the one that came in the box). They've had battery recalls in the past. I asked the technical support rep if she encountered this before and she said "Yes with other models" so she volunteered that information and now I don't feel comfortable buying a T560 either. Didn't try to help, customer service didn't try and help keep me as a customer either. ALSO THE TRACKPAD is horrible, the clicking is above the trackpad so you have to either twist your fingers or use both hands. I was so excited for a great fully loaded thinkpad but product and service was lacking Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 5 out of 5 by PhotoAvalanche from Best Portable Workstation - With Some Issues First off, the product description is limited, use this for real info: https://www.lenovo.com/psref/pdf/ThinkPad.pdf P50s is p.149 If what you are looking for is a high-performance laptop that you can take into the field all day without worrying about battery life and exposure to elements - look no further - especially if you are a photographer, explorer, traveler, champion. I spent roughly 5 straight weeks furiously analyzing the best laptop for my needs(I have a ridiculousl spreadsheet of comparisons). What I wanted: -High-res Display (at least 2880x1620) with Outdoor Brightness -i7 Skylake CPU -8+hrs Battery Life (at least enough to get through all 3 Mel Gibson Mad Max films) -Excellent Keyboard -Durability -Highly-Responsive Touchpad -Relatively Portable (not a 6in thick, 50lb beast that needs a trailer and hitch) Ability to Dock and Run: >4k Monitor >Graphics Accessories (wacom intuos pro, external storage, speakers, etc.) This laptop does all of these with ease with only a couple issues. The Good: -Yes, it has an i7 Skylake and can run a 4k and other gear from a dock - I chose the 90W Ultra Dock. -Display has excellent resolution, viewing angles, and light distribution - I chose the 3K, great for long periods of reading and for looking at thumbnails in Lightroom CC -Battery life is unreal, I got the biggest battery and it was hands down worth the cost, I can work non-stop for at least 8hrs using demanding programs. -Keyboard is the best on the market - excellent travel and nifty shortcuts. Not to mention the signature trackpoint. Also spill proof which is great. -Extremely portable - amazing weight for the hardware. The largest battery sticks up from the bottom slightly - maybe a 1/2-3/4". It sports it's own rubber feet. At first this concerned me, but now I can't imagine living without it, the slight angle of difference it ads improves typing experience, not to mention that when you close the laptop it gives something to gripwith one hand - I do this all the time and it feels good like palming a basketball. -Ultra dock is great, but I have had difficulties with the Display Port - but this could be a software issue. The Bad: - Brightness: On the pdf I linked above Lenovo states the brightness of the 3K screen is 350nits - a big reason I purchased this laptop. I often work outside and need that brightness. I can say one thing with certainty: this screen is NOT 350 nits. Side by side with a 2013 laptop (Lenovo blocks reviews that have competitor's names so I'll just say it's the kind that features half eaten fruit for a logo) and it's NOT AS BRIGHT as the other. The 2013 laptop has a max brightness of about 250 nits, which means lenovo's screen is ONE THIRD less bright than promised. This makes a big difference when working outdoors. I have been able to get by on overcast days, but when it's sunny, even if I'm in the shade, it makes viewing extremely difficult. - Touchpad: First of all, I don't really mind the offset touchpad, I was concerned after all the negative reviews but it doesn't bother me even when I'm using it on my chest lying on the couch. That being said, there are other issues. I expected better from a thinkpad - my touchpad has very high friction - so much it feels textured compared to other laptops I own. I also have a lot of issues with responsiveness - moments when it flat out doesn't respond for a fraction of a second, this may not sound like much, but it means a frozen cursor multiple times a day, photos being dropped into the wrong folder, and other very frustrating inconveniences. If it weren't for the other great features I would have returned it for this reason, but I hold out hope these glitches will be fixed by a driver update. - External Monitor: It runs an external 4k or UHD monitor at 30HZ via HDMI but I have have yet to get it to function using the Display Port on the 90W Ultra Dock - if I do manage to use a monitor through the DP using the Integrated Intel 520 Graphics then it should work at 60HZ. Support: I have had a terrible time with Lenovo tech support, perhaps because this is a newer model they are not yet accustomed to, but every time I have needed help taking it apart or with the external monitor I have to wait while they look up each component and read to me from PDF's I've already read. Not helpful. I spent many countless hours researching laptops and despite some frustrations this is still my favorite. Use it every day.

Pros • Startup is very fast (about 10 seconds), largely due to the SSD • Heat is very low; fan is only running when playing game or streaming • Off center Keyboard is fine for me • Keyboard backlight is fancy but still miss the old “thinkpad light” • Speaker is much better than T530; louder and heavier • Light weight as a 15 inches pc • Like the 15 inches screen; way better than T460 Cons • No memory slot at the back of laptop; guess need to take off the keyboard to update the memory • First-time battery charging took very long; also, it takes turn to charge the two batteries instead of charging two at the same time; battery is produced in japan and assembly in china and it is very small and light • The trackpoint is temporarily freezing (few seconds) when the CPU is 100% Date published: 2016-03-29 W700 Reviews - page 2 2016-10-16T08:26CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvrr, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasreviews, tv_0, tr_18 loc_en_US, sid_F112727048C6688C2BC5D5350E7FA47B_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_relevancy clientName_Lenovo
Rated 1 out of 5 by Firsttimelasttime from Battery Issue out the box! Instantly had a battery issue! Non-lenovo battery detected (it was the one that came in the box). They've had battery recalls in the past. I asked the technical support rep if she encountered this before and she said "Yes with other models" so she volunteered that information and now I don't feel comfortable buying a T560 either. Didn't try to help, customer service didn't try and help keep me as a customer either. ALSO THE TRACKPAD is horrible, the clicking is above the trackpad so you have to either twist your fingers or use both hands. I was so excited for a great fully loaded thinkpad but product and service was lacking Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 5 out of 5 by PhotoAvalanche from Best Portable Workstation - With Some Issues First off, the product description is limited, use this for real info: https://www.lenovo.com/psref/pdf/ThinkPad.pdf P50s is p.149 If what you are looking for is a high-performance laptop that you can take into the field all day without worrying about battery life and exposure to elements - look no further - especially if you are a photographer, explorer, traveler, champion. I spent roughly 5 straight weeks furiously analyzing the best laptop for my needs(I have a ridiculousl spreadsheet of comparisons). What I wanted: -High-res Display (at least 2880x1620) with Outdoor Brightness -i7 Skylake CPU -8+hrs Battery Life (at least enough to get through all 3 Mel Gibson Mad Max films) -Excellent Keyboard -Durability -Highly-Responsive Touchpad -Relatively Portable (not a 6in thick, 50lb beast that needs a trailer and hitch) Ability to Dock and Run: >4k Monitor >Graphics Accessories (wacom intuos pro, external storage, speakers, etc.) This laptop does all of these with ease with only a couple issues. The Good: -Yes, it has an i7 Skylake and can run a 4k and other gear from a dock - I chose the 90W Ultra Dock. -Display has excellent resolution, viewing angles, and light distribution - I chose the 3K, great for long periods of reading and for looking at thumbnails in Lightroom CC -Battery life is unreal, I got the biggest battery and it was hands down worth the cost, I can work non-stop for at least 8hrs using demanding programs. -Keyboard is the best on the market - excellent travel and nifty shortcuts. Not to mention the signature trackpoint. Also spill proof which is great. -Extremely portable - amazing weight for the hardware. The largest battery sticks up from the bottom slightly - maybe a 1/2-3/4". It sports it's own rubber feet. At first this concerned me, but now I can't imagine living without it, the slight angle of difference it ads improves typing experience, not to mention that when you close the laptop it gives something to gripwith one hand - I do this all the time and it feels good like palming a basketball. -Ultra dock is great, but I have had difficulties with the Display Port - but this could be a software issue.

Is there a similar 15 inch model with the track pad more centered? Asked by: scooter72 No, Lenovo has stopped making 15-inch laptops with centered keyboards. This is a huge problem that many Lenovo customers are having. To those who say "the trackpoint is in the right place because it's in the middle of the keyboard area", you are not listening to the problem. THE KEYBOARD ITSELF SHOULD BE CENTERED, THEN THE TRACKPOINT WOULD BE CENTERED. THEY TRACKPOINT IS IN THE WRONG PLACE BECAUSE THE WHOLE KEYBOARD IS IN THE WRONG PLACE. IF YOU WANT A NUMPAD FINE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR A CENTERED KEYBOARD WITH A CENTERED TRACKPOINT AND NO NUMPAD.
