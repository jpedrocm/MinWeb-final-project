Powered by high-performance 6th gen Intel® Core™ processors with Dynamic Overclocking on K-series CPUs, and offering a new USB Type-C™ port with support for SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps (USB 3.1) and Thunderbolt™3 technologies, the Alienware 17 is designed to give you the best experience on an impressive screen. When paired with the optional Alienware Graphics Amplifier featuring a desktop GPU of your choice, you can transform the Alienware 17 into the ultimate at-home entertainment experience.

Alienware 17 Gaming Laptop Big screen. Big performance. The Alienware 17 is thinner and lighter than any 17" laptop we've created before, but that doesn't mean we skimped on performance. It's crafted with aerospace-inspired carbon fiber filled surfaces that add stiffness and durability, copper heat sinks that enable proper cooling and now offering an optional Ultra HD 4K display built with IGZO (indium gallium zinc oxide) technology. Powered by high-performance 6th gen Intel® Core™ processors with Dynamic Overclocking on K-series CPUs, and offering a new USB Type-C™ port with support for SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps (USB 3.1) and Thunderbolt™3 technologies, the Alienware 17 is designed to give you the best experience on an impressive screen. When paired with the optional Alienware Graphics Amplifier featuring a desktop GPU of your choice, you can transform the Alienware 17 into the ultimate at-home entertainment experience. Just plug in and get lost in the vivid display and massive performance boost of desktop-class graphics. Introducing Intel's best processor ever: Heroic experiences await thanks to the stunning graphics and astounding performance of new 6th generation Intel® Core™ processor based devices running Windows 10 with DirectX 12. The new standard for PC performance has arrived with Intel® 6th Gen Core™ processors! This blazing fast, feature packed processor has built-in security and is ready to take your productivity, creativity and 3D gaming to the next level. Amplified graphics. Advanced gaming. Plug in. Buckle up: Supercharge your at-home gaming with the optional Alienware Graphics Amplifier. Simply plug in the Alienware 17, reboot and enjoy a fully expanded desktop experience with advanced 4K NVIDIA ® or AMD- enabled graphics, multiple-monitor display and more connectivity with a built-in 4-port USB 3.0 hub. Killer combo: Get desktop graphics performance when you pair a sleeker, space-saving Alienware 17 with the Graphics Amplifier. Place your amp out of the way and connect with a single cable for ultimate flexibility with maximum immersion. Extreme built-in graphics options: Blow-your-doors-off gaming excitement comes jam-packed into the Alienware 17 itself, too, with NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 970M or 980M graphics card options and up to 4GB of GDDR5. These are the highest class of mobile graphics cards available. Now the most graphics-rich games can be played at their quickest with support for graphics cards requiring up to a whopping 100W of mobile graphics power. By increasing your graphics performance the Alienware Graphics Amplifier can unlock the exhilarating world of VR gaming on your notebook. In order to have the best Virtual Reality experience we recommend using Alienware with the specs recommended by HTC and Vive. Cutting edge craftsmanship. Carbon fiber craftsmanship: Inspired by aerospace technologies, the carbon fiber composites in Alienware laptops deliver a unique rigidity and high stiffness-to-weight ratio. The result is a whole new tactile experience. Sleek. Solid. Aluminum.: Displays this good require serious protection, so we encased them in an anodized aluminum shell that matches the hinge strength and structural rigidity and boasts a new, iconic design. Cooler with copper: Churn out maximum power while keeping your cool. Copper thermal modules allow your graphics cards and processors to perform at the highest level while the heat pipes and blocks prevent overheating. Guaranteed up to 10 million keystrokes: Experience the sensation of uniform feedback with the reinforced steel plate of our TactX keyboard, which also protects internal components from debris. Launch shortcuts to applications or even macros in-game, thanks to nine customizable keys capable of up to 19 unique commands, programmed via the Alienware Command Center software. Rigorously tested for robust durability: Alienware laptops are tested to stand up to tens of thousands of functions : power button pushes, hinges opening and closing, twists, turns, and up to 1 million touchpad strokes. We test hard so you can game hard, reliably. Built for intense gaming. Lean and mean on a big screen: Enjoy IPS (in-plane switching)-based LCD technology on an expansive 17" screen that offers stunningly clear color and clarity. Get up to pixel density for astonishing color clarity, and extra wide viewing angles. Sound and fury: Rich, impressive audio is powered by Klipsch and Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi technology. Visually connect with comrades and competitors with a 2.0MP Full HD webcam and let the banter flow with a dual microphone array. Full-throttle gaming. More power: Alienware 17 automatically overclocks and monitors internal temperatures to keep your system running cool when the action is hot and deliver performance precisely when you need it. The family powerhouse: Outfitted with the latest generation of up to a Quad-Core 6thgen Intel® Core™ processor with Turbo Boost on an Intel® HM170 Chipset for full-throttle action, it is equipped for advanced power and a seamless gaming experience.

Blow your hair back: Use your USB Type- C™ port as a Thunderbolt 3 port, and experience up to 40Gbps; drive 4K displays as if the port were a Thunderbolt or DisplayPort. Or maximize your options by daisychaining your Thunderbolt devices together. Better, faster, clearer: Run 4K resolution content @60Hz using the new HDMI 2.0 port, for better resolution, smoother graphics and an overall upgrade in awesomeness. Unleash your rig's greatest capabilities with Windows 10 DirectX 12: Break down boundaries and step into your game with graphics more stunning than ever before with the new DirectX 12 technology.
