Dunno why, but after I loaded Office 2010 and Webroot (my security suite of choice) the machine got really buggy until I performed a restore (very convenient in Win 10). Then I removed the clunky onboard McAffee before loading Webroot, and the machine has worked quite well. Great battery life, good in tablet mode, a solid feel, nice keyboard. Many reviewers talk about upgrading to 8 GB ram right away, but with a SSD I am not sure that is necessary. We'll see. Date published: 2016-07-07 Rated 5 out of 5 by Bodiddly39 from Great buy for the money I needed a new small basic computer and came across this and it looked to good to be true. For the money this is a small durable quick computer for the basic needs I have. It might have been better if it had the track point I was use to using but that was easy enough to overcome. The Yoga features, folds into a tablet for reading and viewing videos is great for a computer under $600.00. You just can't beat the included features and the sound was good for a laptop. The included wired network port is good to have in a pinch as most small computers have removed all useful ports. It even has a full size HDMI output to connect a monitor. Great computer for the money. Date published: 2016-08-09 Rated 4 out of 5 by Grafficgal from Excellent machine, great value I had been looking for a laptop for several months when I found this Yoga 11e on Amazon for a great price. After being tied to a desktop for years, it is refreshing to have mobility, I can travel and still keep up with bills and emails. It has all the features I needed including the SSD, touch screen and ability to double as a tablet. I will be giving my tablet to my grandson. I have been using this for about a month and could not be happier. I really like the fact that it is light weight without being a "light weight" computer in processing power and features.

Dunno why, but after I loaded Office 2010 and Webroot (my security suite of choice) the machine got really buggy until I performed a restore (very convenient in Win 10). Then I removed the clunky onboard McAffee before loading Webroot, and the machine has worked quite well. Great battery life, good in tablet mode, a solid feel, nice keyboard. Many reviewers talk about upgrading to 8 GB ram right away, but with a SSD I am not sure that is necessary. We'll see. Date published: 2016-07-07 Rated 5 out of 5 by Bodiddly39 from Great buy for the money I needed a new small basic computer and came across this and it looked to good to be true. For the money this is a small durable quick computer for the basic needs I have. It might have been better if it had the track point I was use to using but that was easy enough to overcome. The Yoga features, folds into a tablet for reading and viewing videos is great for a computer under $600.00. You just can't beat the included features and the sound was good for a laptop. The included wired network port is good to have in a pinch as most small computers have removed all useful ports. It even has a full size HDMI output to connect a monitor. Great computer for the money. Date published: 2016-08-09 Rated 4 out of 5 by Grafficgal from Excellent machine, great value I had been looking for a laptop for several months when I found this Yoga 11e on Amazon for a great price. After being tied to a desktop for years, it is refreshing to have mobility, I can travel and still keep up with bills and emails. It has all the features I needed including the SSD, touch screen and ability to double as a tablet. I will be giving my tablet to my grandson. I have been using this for about a month and could not be happier. I really like the fact that it is light weight without being a "light weight" computer in processing power and features.

Rated 4 out of 5 by alec45 from Works well after a reset Got this machine about a month ago as a travel computer, and am quite pleased. $310 off of Amazon was well worth it. Dunno why, but after I loaded Office 2010 and Webroot (my security suite of choice) the machine got really buggy until I performed a restore (very convenient in Win 10). Then I removed the clunky onboard McAffee before loading Webroot, and the machine has worked quite well. Great battery life, good in tablet mode, a solid feel, nice keyboard. Many reviewers talk about upgrading to 8 GB ram right away, but with a SSD I am not sure that is necessary. We'll see. Date published: 2016-07-07 Rated 5 out of 5 by Bodiddly39 from Great buy for the money I needed a new small basic computer and came across this and it looked to good to be true. For the money this is a small durable quick computer for the basic needs I have. It might have been better if it had the track point I was use to using but that was easy enough to overcome. The Yoga features, folds into a tablet for reading and viewing videos is great for a computer under $600.00. You just can't beat the included features and the sound was good for a laptop. The included wired network port is good to have in a pinch as most small computers have removed all useful ports. It even has a full size HDMI output to connect a monitor. Great computer for the money. Date published: 2016-08-09 Rated 4 out of 5 by Grafficgal from Excellent machine, great value I had been looking for a laptop for several months when I found this Yoga 11e on Amazon for a great price. After being tied to a desktop for years, it is refreshing to have mobility, I can travel and still keep up with bills and emails. It has all the features I needed including the SSD, touch screen and ability to double as a tablet. I will be giving my tablet to my grandson. I have been using this for about a month and could not be happier. I really like the fact that it is light weight without being a "light weight" computer in processing power and features.
