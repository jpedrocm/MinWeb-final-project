Get creative all day You can work all day without charging thanks to the 13 hour battery life, which makes it perfect for a long day at university or the office. It runs on Windows, so anything you'd normally use your laptop for is compatible with the YOGA Book, from working on complex documents to streaming TV-on-demand during down time. Microsoft Office & Internet security This PC doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security.

Real Pen stylus Write, draw, and annotate like on real paper with the Real Pen stylus. Alongside working on the touchscreen and Halo keyboard, it works on paper too.
