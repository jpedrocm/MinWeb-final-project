Write a review Read all reviews Rated 1 out of 5 by unsatisfiedcustomer500 Warranty? Have had this computer for a little under a year. I have never dropped this computer but for some reason there are a few small cracks on both sides of the computer. My audio jack stopped working (cannot connect to headphones) and there are cracks around the audio jack. Again, I have never dropped the computer. This issue is not considered covered under warranty and so if I wanted it fixed, I would have to pay a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. This was a $1,000 computer and it definitely upsets me that I have had it for less than a year and that my problem will not be fixed. Would not recommend, as if you run into any issues, it probably won't be covered under warranty. July 20, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Viveck This is a great product but I recieved a defective Performance is great. Battery power is good. Touch sensitivity is marvelous. But with this weight you can't use it as good as you think. Not advisable if you think you can use it as tab. Also I received a defective item :( I am hearing annoying sound near power jacket :( The noice is irritating :( April 16, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by JeleM Great product The HP ENVY x360 is a great product to work with, well worth the money i spent on it. The 360 feature is a masterpiece. The touch i a marvel. i use the laptop for various tasks and it works great. April 5, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by kenahshae Nothing but problems I purchased this computer from another retailer but it has been nothing but trouble. The computer came to me with no hard drive on it and the repair cost me a ton because the warranty was up within a month. Now 5 months later I find my computer with a crack on it and visible scorch marks and ash residue. It gets really hot and makes a lot of noise. I love the concept though. When I was using it I loved the key board and flipping the screen for movies etc. I feel like there are some hard ware issues though. My battery never lasted very long either. March 7, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by camlen92 Great laptop for school, work, life The reason I am posting this review is because I see so many others posting bad reviews about the laptop not being on par with their expectations. It has exceeded my expectations which are pretty high! The hardware inside the laptop works just like it should. At this price range you will be making some sort of sacrifices in some areas to have better specs in others. The screen works really well as is quite bright and vivid. Since it is touchscreen, the screen is glossy and can attract fingerprints if you use it often. My recommendation is to bring a microfiber towelette to wipe it if that sort of thing bugs you. The hard drive is also somewhere HP had to compromise in order to keep costs down. It is only a 5400 RPM, 1 terabyte drive but it works pretty well. Just don't expect SSD boot-up speeds with it. The processor, RAM, and discrete graphics cards really seal the deal with this laptop. There has yet to be a program or situation where the laptop hasn't been able to handle it. My wife and I play games on it, but nothing too intensive since we know that the hardware is not meant for high-end gaming. But if you like playing MOBAs or The Sims on 1080p gaming with 40-60 FPS, you will be happy with this setup. The battery life is nothing to complain about. It runs around 5 hours on a charge using recommended battery settings, and around 7 hours on power saver mode. I tend to adjust the screen brightness manually and that gets me somewhere in-between those two averages. Charging from 0% to 100% only takes me about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I almost forgot to mention that it is really nice having the screen able to rotate all the way around. It can get you some great viewing angles and if you like holding the laptop like a tablet (which I don't really recommend doing since it weighs a considerable amount more than a tablet), you can do so. TL;DR This laptop is great for students, great for the average internet browser, and great for the working person on the go. Don't buy into the bad reviews especially if they don't give good reasons to not buy it. March 1, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by ZionAbsolute Continuous driver noise I love HP and that is all I have ever owned but this laptop never stops making a noise like it is always thinking! Very annoying! Why can't it be quiet like my other HP laptops. It sounds like something is just going to stop working at some point.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 1 out of 5 by unsatisfiedcustomer500 Warranty? Have had this computer for a little under a year. I have never dropped this computer but for some reason there are a few small cracks on both sides of the computer. My audio jack stopped working (cannot connect to headphones) and there are cracks around the audio jack. Again, I have never dropped the computer. This issue is not considered covered under warranty and so if I wanted it fixed, I would have to pay a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. This was a $1,000 computer and it definitely upsets me that I have had it for less than a year and that my problem will not be fixed. Would not recommend, as if you run into any issues, it probably won't be covered under warranty. July 20, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Viveck This is a great product but I recieved a defective Performance is great. Battery power is good. Touch sensitivity is marvelous. But with this weight you can't use it as good as you think. Not advisable if you think you can use it as tab. Also I received a defective item :( I am hearing annoying sound near power jacket :( The noice is irritating :( April 16, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by JeleM Great product The HP ENVY x360 is a great product to work with, well worth the money i spent on it. The 360 feature is a masterpiece. The touch i a marvel. i use the laptop for various tasks and it works great. April 5, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by kenahshae Nothing but problems I purchased this computer from another retailer but it has been nothing but trouble. The computer came to me with no hard drive on it and the repair cost me a ton because the warranty was up within a month. Now 5 months later I find my computer with a crack on it and visible scorch marks and ash residue. It gets really hot and makes a lot of noise. I love the concept though. When I was using it I loved the key board and flipping the screen for movies etc. I feel like there are some hard ware issues though. My battery never lasted very long either. March 7, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by camlen92 Great laptop for school, work, life The reason I am posting this review is because I see so many others posting bad reviews about the laptop not being on par with their expectations. It has exceeded my expectations which are pretty high! The hardware inside the laptop works just like it should. At this price range you will be making some sort of sacrifices in some areas to have better specs in others. The screen works really well as is quite bright and vivid. Since it is touchscreen, the screen is glossy and can attract fingerprints if you use it often. My recommendation is to bring a microfiber towelette to wipe it if that sort of thing bugs you. The hard drive is also somewhere HP had to compromise in order to keep costs down. It is only a 5400 RPM, 1 terabyte drive but it works pretty well. Just don't expect SSD boot-up speeds with it. The processor, RAM, and discrete graphics cards really seal the deal with this laptop. There has yet to be a program or situation where the laptop hasn't been able to handle it. My wife and I play games on it, but nothing too intensive since we know that the hardware is not meant for high-end gaming. But if you like playing MOBAs or The Sims on 1080p gaming with 40-60 FPS, you will be happy with this setup. The battery life is nothing to complain about. It runs around 5 hours on a charge using recommended battery settings, and around 7 hours on power saver mode. I tend to adjust the screen brightness manually and that gets me somewhere in-between those two averages. Charging from 0% to 100% only takes me about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I almost forgot to mention that it is really nice having the screen able to rotate all the way around. It can get you some great viewing angles and if you like holding the laptop like a tablet (which I don't really recommend doing since it weighs a considerable amount more than a tablet), you can do so. TL;DR This laptop is great for students, great for the average internet browser, and great for the working person on the go. Don't buy into the bad reviews especially if they don't give good reasons to not buy it. March 1, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by ZionAbsolute Continuous driver noise I love HP and that is all I have ever owned but this laptop never stops making a noise like it is always thinking! Very annoying! Why can't it be quiet like my other HP laptops. It sounds like something is just going to stop working at some point.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 1 out of 5 by unsatisfiedcustomer500 Warranty? Have had this computer for a little under a year. I have never dropped this computer but for some reason there are a few small cracks on both sides of the computer. My audio jack stopped working (cannot connect to headphones) and there are cracks around the audio jack. Again, I have never dropped the computer. This issue is not considered covered under warranty and so if I wanted it fixed, I would have to pay a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. This was a $1,000 computer and it definitely upsets me that I have had it for less than a year and that my problem will not be fixed. Would not recommend, as if you run into any issues, it probably won't be covered under warranty. July 20, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Viveck This is a great product but I recieved a defective Performance is great. Battery power is good. Touch sensitivity is marvelous. But with this weight you can't use it as good as you think. Not advisable if you think you can use it as tab. Also I received a defective item :( I am hearing annoying sound near power jacket :( The noice is irritating :( April 16, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by JeleM Great product The HP ENVY x360 is a great product to work with, well worth the money i spent on it. The 360 feature is a masterpiece. The touch i a marvel. i use the laptop for various tasks and it works great. April 5, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by kenahshae Nothing but problems I purchased this computer from another retailer but it has been nothing but trouble. The computer came to me with no hard drive on it and the repair cost me a ton because the warranty was up within a month. Now 5 months later I find my computer with a crack on it and visible scorch marks and ash residue. It gets really hot and makes a lot of noise. I love the concept though. When I was using it I loved the key board and flipping the screen for movies etc. I feel like there are some hard ware issues though. My battery never lasted very long either. March 7, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by camlen92 Great laptop for school, work, life The reason I am posting this review is because I see so many others posting bad reviews about the laptop not being on par with their expectations. It has exceeded my expectations which are pretty high! The hardware inside the laptop works just like it should. At this price range you will be making some sort of sacrifices in some areas to have better specs in others. The screen works really well as is quite bright and vivid. Since it is touchscreen, the screen is glossy and can attract fingerprints if you use it often. My recommendation is to bring a microfiber towelette to wipe it if that sort of thing bugs you. The hard drive is also somewhere HP had to compromise in order to keep costs down. It is only a 5400 RPM, 1 terabyte drive but it works pretty well. Just don't expect SSD boot-up speeds with it. The processor, RAM, and discrete graphics cards really seal the deal with this laptop. There has yet to be a program or situation where the laptop hasn't been able to handle it. My wife and I play games on it, but nothing too intensive since we know that the hardware is not meant for high-end gaming. But if you like playing MOBAs or The Sims on 1080p gaming with 40-60 FPS, you will be happy with this setup. The battery life is nothing to complain about. It runs around 5 hours on a charge using recommended battery settings, and around 7 hours on power saver mode. I tend to adjust the screen brightness manually and that gets me somewhere in-between those two averages. Charging from 0% to 100% only takes me about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I almost forgot to mention that it is really nice having the screen able to rotate all the way around. It can get you some great viewing angles and if you like holding the laptop like a tablet (which I don't really recommend doing since it weighs a considerable amount more than a tablet), you can do so. TL;DR This laptop is great for students, great for the average internet browser, and great for the working person on the go. Don't buy into the bad reviews especially if they don't give good reasons to not buy it. March 1, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by ZionAbsolute Continuous driver noise I love HP and that is all I have ever owned but this laptop never stops making a noise like it is always thinking! Very annoying! Why can't it be quiet like my other HP laptops. It sounds like something is just going to stop working at some point.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 1 out of 5 by unsatisfiedcustomer500 Warranty? Have had this computer for a little under a year. I have never dropped this computer but for some reason there are a few small cracks on both sides of the computer. My audio jack stopped working (cannot connect to headphones) and there are cracks around the audio jack. Again, I have never dropped the computer. This issue is not considered covered under warranty and so if I wanted it fixed, I would have to pay a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. This was a $1,000 computer and it definitely upsets me that I have had it for less than a year and that my problem will not be fixed. Would not recommend, as if you run into any issues, it probably won't be covered under warranty. July 20, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Viveck This is a great product but I recieved a defective Performance is great. Battery power is good. Touch sensitivity is marvelous. But with this weight you can't use it as good as you think. Not advisable if you think you can use it as tab. Also I received a defective item :( I am hearing annoying sound near power jacket :( The noice is irritating :( April 16, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by JeleM Great product The HP ENVY x360 is a great product to work with, well worth the money i spent on it. The 360 feature is a masterpiece. The touch i a marvel. i use the laptop for various tasks and it works great. April 5, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by kenahshae Nothing but problems I purchased this computer from another retailer but it has been nothing but trouble. The computer came to me with no hard drive on it and the repair cost me a ton because the warranty was up within a month. Now 5 months later I find my computer with a crack on it and visible scorch marks and ash residue. It gets really hot and makes a lot of noise. I love the concept though. When I was using it I loved the key board and flipping the screen for movies etc. I feel like there are some hard ware issues though. My battery never lasted very long either. March 7, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by camlen92 Great laptop for school, work, life The reason I am posting this review is because I see so many others posting bad reviews about the laptop not being on par with their expectations. It has exceeded my expectations which are pretty high! The hardware inside the laptop works just like it should. At this price range you will be making some sort of sacrifices in some areas to have better specs in others. The screen works really well as is quite bright and vivid. Since it is touchscreen, the screen is glossy and can attract fingerprints if you use it often. My recommendation is to bring a microfiber towelette to wipe it if that sort of thing bugs you. The hard drive is also somewhere HP had to compromise in order to keep costs down. It is only a 5400 RPM, 1 terabyte drive but it works pretty well. Just don't expect SSD boot-up speeds with it. The processor, RAM, and discrete graphics cards really seal the deal with this laptop. There has yet to be a program or situation where the laptop hasn't been able to handle it. My wife and I play games on it, but nothing too intensive since we know that the hardware is not meant for high-end gaming. But if you like playing MOBAs or The Sims on 1080p gaming with 40-60 FPS, you will be happy with this setup. The battery life is nothing to complain about. It runs around 5 hours on a charge using recommended battery settings, and around 7 hours on power saver mode. I tend to adjust the screen brightness manually and that gets me somewhere in-between those two averages. Charging from 0% to 100% only takes me about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I almost forgot to mention that it is really nice having the screen able to rotate all the way around. It can get you some great viewing angles and if you like holding the laptop like a tablet (which I don't really recommend doing since it weighs a considerable amount more than a tablet), you can do so. TL;DR This laptop is great for students, great for the average internet browser, and great for the working person on the go. Don't buy into the bad reviews especially if they don't give good reasons to not buy it. March 1, 2016 Rated 3 out of 5 by ZionAbsolute Continuous driver noise I love HP and that is all I have ever owned but this laptop never stops making a noise like it is always thinking! Very annoying! Why can't it be quiet like my other HP laptops. It sounds like something is just going to stop working at some point.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 1 out of 5 by unsatisfiedcustomer500 Warranty? Have had this computer for a little under a year. I have never dropped this computer but for some reason there are a few small cracks on both sides of the computer. My audio jack stopped working (cannot connect to headphones) and there are cracks around the audio jack. Again, I have never dropped the computer. This issue is not considered covered under warranty and so if I wanted it fixed, I would have to pay a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. This was a $1,000 computer and it definitely upsets me that I have had it for less than a year and that my problem will not be fixed. Would not recommend, as if you run into any issues, it probably won't be covered under warranty. July 20, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by Viveck This is a great product but I recieved a defective Performance is great. Battery power is good. Touch sensitivity is marvelous. But with this weight you can't use it as good as you think. Not advisable if you think you can use it as tab. Also I received a defective item :( I am hearing annoying sound near power jacket :( The noice is irritating :( April 16, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by JeleM Great product The HP ENVY x360 is a great product to work with, well worth the money i spent on it. The 360 feature is a masterpiece. The touch i a marvel. i use the laptop for various tasks and it works great. April 5, 2016 Rated 2 out of 5 by kenahshae Nothing but problems I purchased this computer from another retailer but it has been nothing but trouble. The computer came to me with no hard drive on it and the repair cost me a ton because the warranty was up within a month. Now 5 months later I find my computer with a crack on it and visible scorch marks and ash residue. It gets really hot and makes a lot of noise. I love the concept though. When I was using it I loved the key board and flipping the screen for movies etc. I feel like there are some hard ware issues though. My battery never lasted very long either.
