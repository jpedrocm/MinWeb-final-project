I have no idea why they have the number pad on the keyboard. If you want a number pad, then buy a desktop or an external keyboard. After years of not having a number pad, Lenovo decides to not only add one but to not allow users to have a choice between number and no number pad. Lenovo made a huge mistake adding the number pad and not giving users an option to not have it. You don't do that to loyal customers who want to use a laptop with a normal layout. Major mistake by Lenovo, hopefully soon they will be mature enough to accept their mistake and fix it. Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 1 out of 5 by amitch81624 from Keyboard ruins a good laptop I really want to like this laptop but the off-center keyboard ruins it. Lenovo really needs to provide better options for their laptops; I want a 15.6 inch screen, with at least 2560x1440 resolution, with a centered keyboard. Why is that so hard? Instead, Lenovo provides too many different models, but none of them have what I actually want. I bought this laptop because it was the closest ThinkPad I could find to a 15.6 inch laptop with a decent display, but then when I started using it I hated the off-center keyboard because it's really annoying to always have your hands off to one side. I returned this and got the T460 instead, oh well I guess you just can't get a good 15.6 inch ThinkPad laptop from Lenovo any more. Date published: 2016-06-16 Rated 1 out of 5 by LocN from Cheap plastic business computer, bad quality! After T410, W520 and now this computer T560. The computer looks cheap unfinished product. The other branch consumer computer quality build is more better than this call business computer. I also bought B50-80 which is 1/4 price of T560 that is almost same quality, even the same components. The keyboard accuracy is good but the layout is bad. B50-80 keyboard layout is more better. I got many times blue screen telling graphic card problem. Look how ugly SD card icon your Windows 10 File Explorer! When I got the computer, the screen looks dirty and screws are over torque and stripped. Next computer is not Lenovo. Date published: 2016-04-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by texasaggie from Great for the Right User Ignore the negative reviews if you're the right kind of user - someone that needs a superb keyboard, a numeric keypad and a trackpoint. I'm a financial analyst and was looking for a laptop that I could build complex financial models on even while sitting away from a desk and this laptop fit the ticket perfectly after much searching. I've owned 3 other Lenovo laptops in the past (including a top of the line X1 carbon) and this is my favorite one thus far in terms of features (15" display, performance, value, keyboard). Yes, it isn't as ultraportable as the X1 carbon but for the right user, you'd trade that portability for all the T560's features any day. I also added RAM on this notebook and it was easy given the strong and high quality plastics - could not have said the same for my previous Edge series Lenovo. If you can afford it - avoid the Edge series, they engineered for price so the keyboard and build quality are noticeably inferior. Date published: 2016-05-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve_LWL from Great Laptop I see a lot of people complaining about the keyboard and trackpad being off center (which it is) but maybe they should have looked at the pictures first before buying it. We work at an accounting firm and having the numberpad on the keyboard is the most beneficial part of this laptop. The laptop is well made and is very durable. Definitely a great purchase. Date published: 2016-05-03 Rated 1 out of 5 by thislaptopishurtingme from Terrible keyboard, terrible trackpoint This laptop is unusable. I HATE THE NUMBER PAD, and I HATE THE OFF-CENTER KEYBOARD. The off-center keyboard makes my eyes hurt because my eyes are constantly drawn to the left, where my hands are. When I am using my computer for an extended period of time, small stresses add up to discomfort and pain. I tried this laptop, but I had to stop using it after 30 minutes because I got a headache and my eyes hurt. Why isn't this laptop available with a centered keyboard??? Why doesn't Lenovo make a single 15.6" laptop with a keyboard that has NO NUMBER PAD??? I NEVER USE THE NUMBER PAD. Does that mean I can never have a laptop with a 15.6" screen again in my life? I have been buying ThinkPad laptops since 2007 when I graduated from college. I will never buy another ThinkPad again, EVER, until they offer a 15.6" laptop with NO NUMBER PAD. Date published: 2016-03-31 Rated 4 out of 5 by milleman from So close, but not quite. (Warning: I'm a product test engineer by career, so this may be lengthy and direct for some) I bought similarly configured* L560 and T560 from Lenovo.com, the T on a big sale that cost the same as the lesser L560, my intent to keep the one that suited me better and return the other. (I come from a background of classic 'T' models, the T42 and T60, that have lasted forever, which is the most important quality for any computer -- for me.) I ultimately kept the T560 mostly because if it retails more than the L it must be better, right? Well, for my needs perhaps not. Here are the shortcomings of the T560: 1) The positioning of the ports could not be worse. The Ethernet and 2 USB ports close to the front of the computer puts cables right in my way, always. The headphone jack is on the wrong side and far away. The cooling fan dumps onto my mouse hand position. 2) Why have both a miniDV and HDMI port? miniDV-to-HDMI adapters are common and cheap and miniDV is higher-rez than HDMI. We would be far better served with a 4th USB port in place of the HDMI. 3) On my machine, the infamous 220Hz PWM backlight is flickering at any brightness below 100%. I installed a script to raise the frequency up to 1000Hz, but other manufacturers, indeed other ThinkPads, don't use this fatiguing scheme. I confirmed that in fact my particular computer behaves this way. 4) Lenovo could have spent another buck to have status lights on the num lock, caps lock and wifi on/off to avoid unnecessary confusion. As well as including a battery/charge status LED by the plug like the L560 to stay aware of that with the computer shut down or sleeping. The stuff you read about is all well and good: keyboard and trackpad, build materials and assembly, lack of bloatware and useful Lenovo apps, long battery life, cool case temps, half-decent speakers, half-decent FHD display. Where the L560 better met my needs and equaled the T560 in my real-world was: 1) the port positioning was MUCH better than the T560, perhaps ideal. 2) there's a 4th USB port instead of an HDMI port, with the miniDV doing A/V duty. 3) although I was dumb to not check my machine directly, all the reports I've read suggests the L560 does not use PWM backlight dimming at all. 4) For MY needs, the L560 integral optical disc drive is essential, and will be cumbersome to buy an external ODD for the T560 and suck up another USB port. 5) Battery life, build materials and construction, keyboard, display, and all the rest all meet my needs as I'm not constantly manhandling my laptop traveling all over the country with it. It's basically a stay-at-home laptop, so any extra durability the T has over the L (slight) is wasted on me. And the L is "mil-spec" tested and probably just as robust. 6) I would have kept the L560 instead of the T560 if a keyboard backlight was available and I had the sense to confirm my L560 did not implement PWM backlight dimming. Bottom line having lived with both for months now is the T560 is everything it should be by today's standards. Not state of the art, not a great value, not a great FHD display, but generally well-designed and built, and if not carrying on the legacy of the best T Thinkpads, at least holding its own. If this can be running well like my T42 has been for a dozen years of use, it will have been a worthwhile purchase. * my configuration for both: Win10-home, i5-6200u, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, fingerprint reader, FHD IPS display, (larger battery and keyboard light on T560).

I will need to look for a lighter 15 inch laptop. I absolutely love lenovo laptops (their matte display, keyboard, touchpad are unmatched) but they need to look in to developing a lighter 15 inch laptop for university/school students who need to carry around their laptops all day but still desire a 15 inch laptop for productivity. Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 1 out of 5 by Eugene Y from num pad keyboard is not a good option for laptop I own T530 and really happy with it. However I cannot upgrade it to one of the newest models because of the numpad keyboard I'm not comfortable with. Date published: 2016-04-23 Rated 1 out of 5 by rosco77 from Please Fix the Keyboard Give us an option not to have the 10key. It would be nice if you would go back the T530 design. Date published: 2016-05-21 Rated 3 out of 5 by santacruzworker from Very Nice Laptop Except For... I recently upgrade to a T560 from my T530. I loved everything about the T530 except the weight. I had skipped the T540 due the horrible track pad without the buttons but decided to go with the T560 since the buttons are back. I like lighter weight of the T560 and the (1980x1080) matte touch display. With a core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, and 24GB of RAM performance is great. Over all it is a good laptop. The one thing that prevents it from being a great laptop is the awful off center keyboard. The feel of the keys is good and I like the backlight but the fact that it is off center completely ruins the user experience. I know I could have purchased a T460 and had a centered keyboard but then I would have to give up the larger display which is important to me. I do software development and the more screen real estate the better. Lenovo received a lot of complaints about the lack of track pad buttons on prior models and fixed that, but for some reason ignored the complaints about the off center keyboard. Just because the 15.5” display gives you room to cram a numeric pad on to the keyboard doesn’t mean you should. I’ll bet that for the majority of users the numeric keypad is useless. Having the keyboard off center makes my left hand hang over the edge of the palm rest which I find uncomfortable. The T530 was very comfortable to type on due to the centered keyboard. So in that respect the T530 was superior to the T560. Why Lenovo doesn’t offer the option of a centered keyboard without the numeric pad on their top of the line business laptop is beyond me. I’ll bet that the off center keyboard becomes the number one complaint for the T560. Hopefully Lenovo will eventually realize their mistake like they did with the track pad buttons and fix the keyboard in the next model. They should also do the same thing for the 15” Thinkpad Yoga, which except for the keyboard, is a very nice laptop. I would recommend to a friend that they take a look at this laptop but I'd warn them about the keyboard and tell them to make sure they are ok with it before purchasing one. Date published: 2016-04-20 Rated 1 out of 5 by mblasko from Off-center keyboard Had been using Thinkpads for almost 20 years for work. 15'' display is my strong preference and I am ten finger typer. I have never experienced such a discomfort working with a laptop as when I have recently exchanged my T520 for new T560. Significantly off-center keyboard feels no doubt very uncomfortable and can not be compensated by added benefit of numeric pad. Lenovo, pls consider reintroducing centered keyboards for 15'' machines.

Easy to transport, easy to type on. Great workhorse for me. I love using it and never have had any issues. Date published: 2016-08-23 Rated 3 out of 5 by jonashendrickx from Heavy, but magnificent battery life. Lenovo could have opted for a quad core processor in the ThinkPad T560, even the i7-6600U feels a bit sluggish for a laptop of this size and weight. The front bezel is a little bit loose on my machine. Aside from that you can expect a broad range of built-in enterprise features, matte touchscreen (without a film) and magnificent battery life around 18 hours. Date published: 2016-06-19 Rated 2 out of 5 by Lenovo_lover from Too heavy to be useful. This is a great laptop in every way but unfortunately it is so heavy (5.35 pounds) that it is not at all portable. Please try to introduce a lighter 15 inch version.T460s (3 pounds) and X1 carbon (2.6 pounds) are 14 inches and weigh almost HALF of this 15 inch model. I love the keyboard, touchpad and the matte screen but the 5.35 pound weight is a deal breaker.

Date published: 2016-07-01 Rated 2 out of 5 by InaKrazosi from Not a laptop - more of a thigh-top What is it with numeric keypads on laptops these days? For the once-a-month that you might need it while balancing your checkbook, you end up with a keyboard that's off to the side, so you have to balance the machine and/or strain your wrists all the time. If I want a numeric keypad, I'll get a full-size keyboard. Date published: 2016-06-19 Rated 5 out of 5 by John12321321 from Great Product! Great Product! I like this system a lot. I would recommend it to a friend. Date published: 2016-05-10 Rated 5 out of 5 by Rig1091 from Very nice keyboard I have been using this for over a month now and I am very happy with how it performs. I was looking for the number pad on the keyboard, and this performs exactly as expected. I am use to having the left click / right click below the touch pad so it is taking some getting use to.

Date published: 2016-08-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by btreloar from Disappointing First Start My new T560 arrived about three weeks ago; I'm using it to replace an older T500 that's havfing some Windows 10 issues with the keyboard and trackpad/trackpoint. I love most of the features, but was mildly disappointed that the screen resolution wasn't higher than 1366x768. That's not a really big deal since I use it 90% on a ThinkPad Pro Dock with an external monitor. But THAT is where the major disappointment came in. In one office where the monitor connects via a VGA connector, there is a 1/2" black bar around all four sides of the screen that covers up the top icons on the desktop and the top line of any window that opens up against the top of the screen, blocking access to thinks like the minimize, window, and close buttons. 'In my other office, where the external monitor connects via a DVI-D connector, the monitor can't see the T560 at all. Needless to say my T500 has had no problems with either of my external monitors. Lenovo Tech support had me send the T560 back for a replacement motherboard and I'm no waiting for it to be repaired and come back. Date published: 2016-05-09 Rated 2 out of 5 by Bbkk from Not IBM Thinkpad anymore It looks like Lenovo is trying to make this their own version of Macabook. I come from X61 tablet & T60, both machine still running strong, and I got this T560 which is more similar to my MacBook than my Thinkpads. Lenovo is trying hard to envolve, that's fine! But PLEASE try to continue the Thinjpad line! Date published: 2016-05-12 Rated 5 out of 5 by Elmi from Great Features!

Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-07-29 The T560 has terrible reviews onsite, involving either the keypad or weight. I rarely use the keypad on the external keyboard I use, so I would probably agree there. If there is no internal DVD drive why has the weight increased so much from the T460? Asked by: WhyT560 I dont work for Lenovo but looks like they dont answer customer questions.. is this foreshadowing? In any case, suspect that the weight comes from the increased battery capacity. The battery is perhaps the most hefty single piece of equipment inside the laptop and there are 2 of them in this one. Ill take a little heft for the extra battery life - this isnt something you will confuse with using as a tablet anyway. Answered by: Nics Date published: 2016-05-21 Can I use use a wacom digitizer pen?

I have no idea why they have the number pad on the keyboard. If you want a number pad, then buy a desktop or an external keyboard. After years of not having a number pad, Lenovo decides to not only add one but to not allow users to have a choice between number and no number pad. Lenovo made a huge mistake adding the number pad and not giving users an option to not have it. You don't do that to loyal customers who want to use a laptop with a normal layout. Major mistake by Lenovo, hopefully soon they will be mature enough to accept their mistake and fix it. Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 1 out of 5 by amitch81624 from Keyboard ruins a good laptop I really want to like this laptop but the off-center keyboard ruins it. Lenovo really needs to provide better options for their laptops; I want a 15.6 inch screen, with at least 2560x1440 resolution, with a centered keyboard. Why is that so hard? Instead, Lenovo provides too many different models, but none of them have what I actually want. I bought this laptop because it was the closest ThinkPad I could find to a 15.6 inch laptop with a decent display, but then when I started using it I hated the off-center keyboard because it's really annoying to always have your hands off to one side. I returned this and got the T460 instead, oh well I guess you just can't get a good 15.6 inch ThinkPad laptop from Lenovo any more.

The other branch consumer computer quality build is more better than this call business computer. I also bought B50-80 which is 1/4 price of T560 that is almost same quality, even the same components. The keyboard accuracy is good but the layout is bad. B50-80 keyboard layout is more better. I got many times blue screen telling graphic card problem. Look how ugly SD card icon your Windows 10 File Explorer! When I got the computer, the screen looks dirty and screws are over torque and stripped. Next computer is not Lenovo.

I'm a financial analyst and was looking for a laptop that I could build complex financial models on even while sitting away from a desk and this laptop fit the ticket perfectly after much searching. I've owned 3 other Lenovo laptops in the past (including a top of the line X1 carbon) and this is my favorite one thus far in terms of features (15" display, performance, value, keyboard). Yes, it isn't as ultraportable as the X1 carbon but for the right user, you'd trade that portability for all the T560's features any day. I also added RAM on this notebook and it was easy given the strong and high quality plastics - could not have said the same for my previous Edge series Lenovo. If you can afford it - avoid the Edge series, they engineered for price so the keyboard and build quality are noticeably inferior. Date published: 2016-05-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve_LWL from Great Laptop I see a lot of people complaining about the keyboard and trackpad being off center (which it is) but maybe they should have looked at the pictures first before buying it. We work at an accounting firm and having the numberpad on the keyboard is the most beneficial part of this laptop. The laptop is well made and is very durable. Definitely a great purchase. Date published: 2016-05-03 Rated 1 out of 5 by thislaptopishurtingme from Terrible keyboard, terrible trackpoint This laptop is unusable. I HATE THE NUMBER PAD, and I HATE THE OFF-CENTER KEYBOARD. The off-center keyboard makes my eyes hurt because my eyes are constantly drawn to the left, where my hands are. When I am using my computer for an extended period of time, small stresses add up to discomfort and pain. I tried this laptop, but I had to stop using it after 30 minutes because I got a headache and my eyes hurt. Why isn't this laptop available with a centered keyboard??? Why doesn't Lenovo make a single 15.6" laptop with a keyboard that has NO NUMBER PAD??? I NEVER USE THE NUMBER PAD. Does that mean I can never have a laptop with a 15.6" screen again in my life? I have been buying ThinkPad laptops since 2007 when I graduated from college. I will never buy another ThinkPad again, EVER, until they offer a 15.6" laptop with NO NUMBER PAD. Date published: 2016-03-31 Rated 4 out of 5 by milleman from So close, but not quite. (Warning: I'm a product test engineer by career, so this may be lengthy and direct for some) I bought similarly configured* L560 and T560 from Lenovo.com, the T on a big sale that cost the same as the lesser L560, my intent to keep the one that suited me better and return the other. (I come from a background of classic 'T' models, the T42 and T60, that have lasted forever, which is the most important quality for any computer -- for me.) I ultimately kept the T560 mostly because if it retails more than the L it must be better, right? Well, for my needs perhaps not. Here are the shortcomings of the T560: 1) The positioning of the ports could not be worse. The Ethernet and 2 USB ports close to the front of the computer puts cables right in my way, always. The headphone jack is on the wrong side and far away. The cooling fan dumps onto my mouse hand position. 2) Why have both a miniDV and HDMI port? miniDV-to-HDMI adapters are common and cheap and miniDV is higher-rez than HDMI. We would be far better served with a 4th USB port in place of the HDMI. 3) On my machine, the infamous 220Hz PWM backlight is flickering at any brightness below 100%. I installed a script to raise the frequency up to 1000Hz, but other manufacturers, indeed other ThinkPads, don't use this fatiguing scheme. I confirmed that in fact my particular computer behaves this way. 4) Lenovo could have spent another buck to have status lights on the num lock, caps lock and wifi on/off to avoid unnecessary confusion. As well as including a battery/charge status LED by the plug like the L560 to stay aware of that with the computer shut down or sleeping. The stuff you read about is all well and good: keyboard and trackpad, build materials and assembly, lack of bloatware and useful Lenovo apps, long battery life, cool case temps, half-decent speakers, half-decent FHD display. Where the L560 better met my needs and equaled the T560 in my real-world was: 1) the port positioning was MUCH better than the T560, perhaps ideal. 2) there's a 4th USB port instead of an HDMI port, with the miniDV doing A/V duty. 3) although I was dumb to not check my machine directly, all the reports I've read suggests the L560 does not use PWM backlight dimming at all. 4) For MY needs, the L560 integral optical disc drive is essential, and will be cumbersome to buy an external ODD for the T560 and suck up another USB port. 5) Battery life, build materials and construction, keyboard, display, and all the rest all meet my needs as I'm not constantly manhandling my laptop traveling all over the country with it. It's basically a stay-at-home laptop, so any extra durability the T has over the L (slight) is wasted on me. And the L is "mil-spec" tested and probably just as robust. 6) I would have kept the L560 instead of the T560 if a keyboard backlight was available and I had the sense to confirm my L560 did not implement PWM backlight dimming. Bottom line having lived with both for months now is the T560 is everything it should be by today's standards. Not state of the art, not a great value, not a great FHD display, but generally well-designed and built, and if not carrying on the legacy of the best T Thinkpads, at least holding its own. If this can be running well like my T42 has been for a dozen years of use, it will have been a worthwhile purchase. * my configuration for both: Win10-home, i5-6200u, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, fingerprint reader, FHD IPS display, (larger battery and keyboard light on T560).

I will need to look for a lighter 15 inch laptop. I absolutely love lenovo laptops (their matte display, keyboard, touchpad are unmatched) but they need to look in to developing a lighter 15 inch laptop for university/school students who need to carry around their laptops all day but still desire a 15 inch laptop for productivity. Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 1 out of 5 by Eugene Y from num pad keyboard is not a good option for laptop I own T530 and really happy with it. However I cannot upgrade it to one of the newest models because of the numpad keyboard I'm not comfortable with. Date published: 2016-04-23 Rated 1 out of 5 by rosco77 from Please Fix the Keyboard Give us an option not to have the 10key. It would be nice if you would go back the T530 design. Date published: 2016-05-21 Rated 3 out of 5 by santacruzworker from Very Nice Laptop Except For... I recently upgrade to a T560 from my T530. I loved everything about the T530 except the weight. I had skipped the T540 due the horrible track pad without the buttons but decided to go with the T560 since the buttons are back. I like lighter weight of the T560 and the (1980x1080) matte touch display. With a core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, and 24GB of RAM performance is great. Over all it is a good laptop. The one thing that prevents it from being a great laptop is the awful off center keyboard. The feel of the keys is good and I like the backlight but the fact that it is off center completely ruins the user experience. I know I could have purchased a T460 and had a centered keyboard but then I would have to give up the larger display which is important to me. I do software development and the more screen real estate the better. Lenovo received a lot of complaints about the lack of track pad buttons on prior models and fixed that, but for some reason ignored the complaints about the off center keyboard. Just because the 15.5” display gives you room to cram a numeric pad on to the keyboard doesn’t mean you should. I’ll bet that for the majority of users the numeric keypad is useless. Having the keyboard off center makes my left hand hang over the edge of the palm rest which I find uncomfortable. The T530 was very comfortable to type on due to the centered keyboard. So in that respect the T530 was superior to the T560. Why Lenovo doesn’t offer the option of a centered keyboard without the numeric pad on their top of the line business laptop is beyond me. I’ll bet that the off center keyboard becomes the number one complaint for the T560. Hopefully Lenovo will eventually realize their mistake like they did with the track pad buttons and fix the keyboard in the next model. They should also do the same thing for the 15” Thinkpad Yoga, which except for the keyboard, is a very nice laptop. I would recommend to a friend that they take a look at this laptop but I'd warn them about the keyboard and tell them to make sure they are ok with it before purchasing one. Date published: 2016-04-20 Rated 1 out of 5 by mblasko from Off-center keyboard Had been using Thinkpads for almost 20 years for work. 15'' display is my strong preference and I am ten finger typer. I have never experienced such a discomfort working with a laptop as when I have recently exchanged my T520 for new T560. Significantly off-center keyboard feels no doubt very uncomfortable and can not be compensated by added benefit of numeric pad. Lenovo, pls consider reintroducing centered keyboards for 15'' machines.

Date published: 2016-08-23 Rated 3 out of 5 by jonashendrickx from Heavy, but magnificent battery life. Lenovo could have opted for a quad core processor in the ThinkPad T560, even the i7-6600U feels a bit sluggish for a laptop of this size and weight. The front bezel is a little bit loose on my machine. Aside from that you can expect a broad range of built-in enterprise features, matte touchscreen (without a film) and magnificent battery life around 18 hours.

This is a great laptop in every way but unfortunately it is so heavy (5.35 pounds) that it is not at all portable. Please try to introduce a lighter 15 inch version.T460s (3 pounds) and X1 carbon (2.6 pounds) are 14 inches and weigh almost HALF of this 15 inch model.

For the once-a-month that you might need it while balancing your checkbook, you end up with a keyboard that's off to the side, so you have to balance the machine and/or strain your wrists all the time.

Date published: 2016-08-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by btreloar from Disappointing First Start My new T560 arrived about three weeks ago; I'm using it to replace an older T500 that's havfing some Windows 10 issues with the keyboard and trackpad/trackpoint. I love most of the features, but was mildly disappointed that the screen resolution wasn't higher than 1366x768. That's not a really big deal since I use it 90% on a ThinkPad Pro Dock with an external monitor. But THAT is where the major disappointment came in. In one office where the monitor connects via a VGA connector, there is a 1/2" black bar around all four sides of the screen that covers up the top icons on the desktop and the top line of any window that opens up against the top of the screen, blocking access to thinks like the minimize, window, and close buttons. 'In my other office, where the external monitor connects via a DVI-D connector, the monitor can't see the T560 at all. Needless to say my T500 has had no problems with either of my external monitors. Lenovo Tech support had me send the T560 back for a replacement motherboard and I'm no waiting for it to be repaired and come back.

Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-07-29 The T560 has terrible reviews onsite, involving either the keypad or weight. I rarely use the keypad on the external keyboard I use, so I would probably agree there. If there is no internal DVD drive why has the weight increased so much from the T460? Asked by: WhyT560 I dont work for Lenovo but looks like they dont answer customer questions.. is this foreshadowing? In any case, suspect that the weight comes from the increased battery capacity. The battery is perhaps the most hefty single piece of equipment inside the laptop and there are 2 of them in this one. Ill take a little heft for the extra battery life - this isnt something you will confuse with using as a tablet anyway.

Rated 1 out of 5 by Parlays from Off center keyboard a joke This computer has really ruined my emotional well-being. I have no idea why they have the number pad on the keyboard. If you want a number pad, then buy a desktop or an external keyboard. After years of not having a number pad, Lenovo decides to not only add one but to not allow users to have a choice between number and no number pad. Lenovo made a huge mistake adding the number pad and not giving users an option to not have it. You don't do that to loyal customers who want to use a laptop with a normal layout. Major mistake by Lenovo, hopefully soon they will be mature enough to accept their mistake and fix it.

Lenovo really needs to provide better options for their laptops; I want a 15.6 inch screen, with at least 2560x1440 resolution, with a centered keyboard. Why is that so hard? Instead, Lenovo provides too many different models, but none of them have what I actually want. I bought this laptop because it was the closest ThinkPad I could find to a 15.6 inch laptop with a decent display, but then when I started using it I hated the off-center keyboard because it's really annoying to always have your hands off to one side. I returned this and got the T460 instead, oh well I guess you just can't get a good 15.6 inch ThinkPad laptop from Lenovo any more.

The other branch consumer computer quality build is more better than this call business computer. I also bought B50-80 which is 1/4 price of T560 that is almost same quality, even the same components. The keyboard accuracy is good but the layout is bad. B50-80 keyboard layout is more better. I got many times blue screen telling graphic card problem. Look how ugly SD card icon your Windows 10 File Explorer! When I got the computer, the screen looks dirty and screws are over torque and stripped. Next computer is not Lenovo.

I'm a financial analyst and was looking for a laptop that I could build complex financial models on even while sitting away from a desk and this laptop fit the ticket perfectly after much searching. I've owned 3 other Lenovo laptops in the past (including a top of the line X1 carbon) and this is my favorite one thus far in terms of features (15" display, performance, value, keyboard). Yes, it isn't as ultraportable as the X1 carbon but for the right user, you'd trade that portability for all the T560's features any day. I also added RAM on this notebook and it was easy given the strong and high quality plastics - could not have said the same for my previous Edge series Lenovo. If you can afford it - avoid the Edge series, they engineered for price so the keyboard and build quality are noticeably inferior. Date published: 2016-05-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve_LWL from Great Laptop I see a lot of people complaining about the keyboard and trackpad being off center (which it is) but maybe they should have looked at the pictures first before buying it. We work at an accounting firm and having the numberpad on the keyboard is the most beneficial part of this laptop. The laptop is well made and is very durable. Definitely a great purchase. Date published: 2016-05-03 Rated 1 out of 5 by thislaptopishurtingme from Terrible keyboard, terrible trackpoint This laptop is unusable. I HATE THE NUMBER PAD, and I HATE THE OFF-CENTER KEYBOARD. The off-center keyboard makes my eyes hurt because my eyes are constantly drawn to the left, where my hands are. When I am using my computer for an extended period of time, small stresses add up to discomfort and pain. I tried this laptop, but I had to stop using it after 30 minutes because I got a headache and my eyes hurt. Why isn't this laptop available with a centered keyboard??? Why doesn't Lenovo make a single 15.6" laptop with a keyboard that has NO NUMBER PAD??? I NEVER USE THE NUMBER PAD. Does that mean I can never have a laptop with a 15.6" screen again in my life? I have been buying ThinkPad laptops since 2007 when I graduated from college. I will never buy another ThinkPad again, EVER, until they offer a 15.6" laptop with NO NUMBER PAD. Date published: 2016-03-31 Rated 4 out of 5 by milleman from So close, but not quite. (Warning: I'm a product test engineer by career, so this may be lengthy and direct for some) I bought similarly configured* L560 and T560 from Lenovo.com, the T on a big sale that cost the same as the lesser L560, my intent to keep the one that suited me better and return the other. (I come from a background of classic 'T' models, the T42 and T60, that have lasted forever, which is the most important quality for any computer -- for me.) I ultimately kept the T560 mostly because if it retails more than the L it must be better, right? Well, for my needs perhaps not. Here are the shortcomings of the T560: 1) The positioning of the ports could not be worse. The Ethernet and 2 USB ports close to the front of the computer puts cables right in my way, always. The headphone jack is on the wrong side and far away. The cooling fan dumps onto my mouse hand position. 2) Why have both a miniDV and HDMI port? miniDV-to-HDMI adapters are common and cheap and miniDV is higher-rez than HDMI. We would be far better served with a 4th USB port in place of the HDMI. 3) On my machine, the infamous 220Hz PWM backlight is flickering at any brightness below 100%. I installed a script to raise the frequency up to 1000Hz, but other manufacturers, indeed other ThinkPads, don't use this fatiguing scheme. I confirmed that in fact my particular computer behaves this way. 4) Lenovo could have spent another buck to have status lights on the num lock, caps lock and wifi on/off to avoid unnecessary confusion. As well as including a battery/charge status LED by the plug like the L560 to stay aware of that with the computer shut down or sleeping. The stuff you read about is all well and good: keyboard and trackpad, build materials and assembly, lack of bloatware and useful Lenovo apps, long battery life, cool case temps, half-decent speakers, half-decent FHD display. Where the L560 better met my needs and equaled the T560 in my real-world was: 1) the port positioning was MUCH better than the T560, perhaps ideal. 2) there's a 4th USB port instead of an HDMI port, with the miniDV doing A/V duty. 3) although I was dumb to not check my machine directly, all the reports I've read suggests the L560 does not use PWM backlight dimming at all. 4) For MY needs, the L560 integral optical disc drive is essential, and will be cumbersome to buy an external ODD for the T560 and suck up another USB port. 5) Battery life, build materials and construction, keyboard, display, and all the rest all meet my needs as I'm not constantly manhandling my laptop traveling all over the country with it. It's basically a stay-at-home laptop, so any extra durability the T has over the L (slight) is wasted on me. And the L is "mil-spec" tested and probably just as robust. 6) I would have kept the L560 instead of the T560 if a keyboard backlight was available and I had the sense to confirm my L560 did not implement PWM backlight dimming. Bottom line having lived with both for months now is the T560 is everything it should be by today's standards. Not state of the art, not a great value, not a great FHD display, but generally well-designed and built, and if not carrying on the legacy of the best T Thinkpads, at least holding its own. If this can be running well like my T42 has been for a dozen years of use, it will have been a worthwhile purchase. * my configuration for both: Win10-home, i5-6200u, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, fingerprint reader, FHD IPS display, (larger battery and keyboard light on T560).

I will need to look for a lighter 15 inch laptop. I absolutely love lenovo laptops (their matte display, keyboard, touchpad are unmatched) but they need to look in to developing a lighter 15 inch laptop for university/school students who need to carry around their laptops all day but still desire a 15 inch laptop for productivity. Date published: 2016-04-12 Rated 1 out of 5 by Eugene Y from num pad keyboard is not a good option for laptop I own T530 and really happy with it. However I cannot upgrade it to one of the newest models because of the numpad keyboard I'm not comfortable with. Date published: 2016-04-23 Rated 1 out of 5 by rosco77 from Please Fix the Keyboard Give us an option not to have the 10key. It would be nice if you would go back the T530 design. Date published: 2016-05-21 Rated 3 out of 5 by santacruzworker from Very Nice Laptop Except For... I recently upgrade to a T560 from my T530. I loved everything about the T530 except the weight. I had skipped the T540 due the horrible track pad without the buttons but decided to go with the T560 since the buttons are back. I like lighter weight of the T560 and the (1980x1080) matte touch display. With a core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, and 24GB of RAM performance is great. Over all it is a good laptop. The one thing that prevents it from being a great laptop is the awful off center keyboard. The feel of the keys is good and I like the backlight but the fact that it is off center completely ruins the user experience. I know I could have purchased a T460 and had a centered keyboard but then I would have to give up the larger display which is important to me. I do software development and the more screen real estate the better. Lenovo received a lot of complaints about the lack of track pad buttons on prior models and fixed that, but for some reason ignored the complaints about the off center keyboard. Just because the 15.5” display gives you room to cram a numeric pad on to the keyboard doesn’t mean you should. I’ll bet that for the majority of users the numeric keypad is useless. Having the keyboard off center makes my left hand hang over the edge of the palm rest which I find uncomfortable. The T530 was very comfortable to type on due to the centered keyboard. So in that respect the T530 was superior to the T560. Why Lenovo doesn’t offer the option of a centered keyboard without the numeric pad on their top of the line business laptop is beyond me. I’ll bet that the off center keyboard becomes the number one complaint for the T560. Hopefully Lenovo will eventually realize their mistake like they did with the track pad buttons and fix the keyboard in the next model. They should also do the same thing for the 15” Thinkpad Yoga, which except for the keyboard, is a very nice laptop. I would recommend to a friend that they take a look at this laptop but I'd warn them about the keyboard and tell them to make sure they are ok with it before purchasing one. Date published: 2016-04-20 Rated 1 out of 5 by mblasko from Off-center keyboard Had been using Thinkpads for almost 20 years for work. 15'' display is my strong preference and I am ten finger typer. I have never experienced such a discomfort working with a laptop as when I have recently exchanged my T520 for new T560. Significantly off-center keyboard feels no doubt very uncomfortable and can not be compensated by added benefit of numeric pad. Lenovo, pls consider reintroducing centered keyboards for 15'' machines. Date published: 2016-08-18 Rated 5 out of 5 by rhopper from Love the Keyboard As an engineer, I needed a computer with a keypad. They are nearly impossible to find. This computer has been amazing. Easy to transport, easy to type on. Great workhorse for me. I love using it and never have had any issues. Date published: 2016-08-23 Rated 3 out of 5 by jonashendrickx from Heavy, but magnificent battery life. Lenovo could have opted for a quad core processor in the ThinkPad T560, even the i7-6600U feels a bit sluggish for a laptop of this size and weight. The front bezel is a little bit loose on my machine. Aside from that you can expect a broad range of built-in enterprise features, matte touchscreen (without a film) and magnificent battery life around 18 hours. Date published: 2016-06-19 Rated 2 out of 5 by Lenovo_lover from Too heavy to be useful. This is a great laptop in every way but unfortunately it is so heavy (5.35 pounds) that it is not at all portable. Please try to introduce a lighter 15 inch version.T460s (3 pounds) and X1 carbon (2.6 pounds) are 14 inches and weigh almost HALF of this 15 inch model. I love the keyboard, touchpad and the matte screen but the 5.35 pound weight is a deal breaker.

Date published: 2016-07-01 Rated 2 out of 5 by InaKrazosi from Not a laptop - more of a thigh-top What is it with numeric keypads on laptops these days? For the once-a-month that you might need it while balancing your checkbook, you end up with a keyboard that's off to the side, so you have to balance the machine and/or strain your wrists all the time. If I want a numeric keypad, I'll get a full-size keyboard. Date published: 2016-06-19 Rated 5 out of 5 by John12321321 from Great Product! Great Product! I like this system a lot.

Date published: 2016-08-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by btreloar from Disappointing First Start My new T560 arrived about three weeks ago; I'm using it to replace an older T500 that's havfing some Windows 10 issues with the keyboard and trackpad/trackpoint. I love most of the features, but was mildly disappointed that the screen resolution wasn't higher than 1366x768. That's not a really big deal since I use it 90% on a ThinkPad Pro Dock with an external monitor. But THAT is where the major disappointment came in. In one office where the monitor connects via a VGA connector, there is a 1/2" black bar around all four sides of the screen that covers up the top icons on the desktop and the top line of any window that opens up against the top of the screen, blocking access to thinks like the minimize, window, and close buttons. 'In my other office, where the external monitor connects via a DVI-D connector, the monitor can't see the T560 at all. Needless to say my T500 has had no problems with either of my external monitors. Lenovo Tech support had me send the T560 back for a replacement motherboard and I'm no waiting for it to be repaired and come back. Date published: 2016-05-09 Rated 2 out of 5 by Bbkk from Not IBM Thinkpad anymore It looks like Lenovo is trying to make this their own version of Macabook. I come from X61 tablet & T60, both machine still running strong, and I got this T560 which is more similar to my MacBook than my Thinkpads. Lenovo is trying hard to envolve, that's fine!

I know I could have purchased a T460 and had a centered keyboard but then I would have to give up the larger display which is important to me. I do software development and the more screen real estate the better. Lenovo received a lot of complaints about the lack of track pad buttons on prior models and fixed that, but for some reason ignored the complaints about the off center keyboard. Just because the 15.5” display gives you room to cram a numeric pad on to the keyboard doesn’t mean you should. I’ll bet that for the majority of users the numeric keypad is useless. Having the keyboard off center makes my left hand hang over the edge of the palm rest which I find uncomfortable. The T530 was very comfortable to type on due to the centered keyboard. So in that respect the T530 was superior to the T560. Why Lenovo doesn’t offer the option of a centered keyboard without the numeric pad on their top of the line business laptop is beyond me. I’ll bet that the off center keyboard becomes the number one complaint for the T560. Hopefully Lenovo will eventually realize their mistake like they did with the track pad buttons and fix the keyboard in the next model. They should also do the same thing for the 15” Thinkpad Yoga, which except for the keyboard, is a very nice laptop. I would recommend to a friend that they take a look at this laptop but I'd warn them about the keyboard and tell them to make sure they are ok with it before purchasing one.

I have never experienced such a discomfort working with a laptop as when I have recently exchanged my T520 for new T560. Significantly off-center keyboard feels no doubt very uncomfortable and can not be compensated by added benefit of numeric pad. Lenovo, pls consider reintroducing centered keyboards for 15'' machines.

Lenovo could have opted for a quad core processor in the ThinkPad T560, even the i7-6600U feels a bit sluggish for a laptop of this size and weight. The front bezel is a little bit loose on my machine. Aside from that you can expect a broad range of built-in enterprise features, matte touchscreen (without a film) and magnificent battery life around 18 hours.

This is a great laptop in every way but unfortunately it is so heavy (5.35 pounds) that it is not at all portable. Please try to introduce a lighter 15 inch version.T460s (3 pounds) and X1 carbon (2.6 pounds) are 14 inches and weigh almost HALF of this 15 inch model. I love the keyboard, touchpad and the matte screen but the 5.35 pound weight is a deal breaker.

For the once-a-month that you might need it while balancing your checkbook, you end up with a keyboard that's off to the side, so you have to balance the machine and/or strain your wrists all the time. If I want a numeric keypad, I'll get a full-size keyboard. Date published: 2016-06-19 Rated 5 out of 5 by John12321321 from Great Product! Great Product! I like this system a lot.

Date published: 2016-08-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by btreloar from Disappointing First Start My new T560 arrived about three weeks ago; I'm using it to replace an older T500 that's havfing some Windows 10 issues with the keyboard and trackpad/trackpoint. I love most of the features, but was mildly disappointed that the screen resolution wasn't higher than 1366x768. That's not a really big deal since I use it 90% on a ThinkPad Pro Dock with an external monitor. But THAT is where the major disappointment came in. In one office where the monitor connects via a VGA connector, there is a 1/2" black bar around all four sides of the screen that covers up the top icons on the desktop and the top line of any window that opens up against the top of the screen, blocking access to thinks like the minimize, window, and close buttons. 'In my other office, where the external monitor connects via a DVI-D connector, the monitor can't see the T560 at all. Needless to say my T500 has had no problems with either of my external monitors. Lenovo Tech support had me send the T560 back for a replacement motherboard and I'm no waiting for it to be repaired and come back.

Rated 1 out of 5 by Parlays from Off center keyboard a joke This computer has really ruined my emotional well-being. I have no idea why they have the number pad on the keyboard. If you want a number pad, then buy a desktop or an external keyboard. After years of not having a number pad, Lenovo decides to not only add one but to not allow users to have a choice between number and no number pad. Lenovo made a huge mistake adding the number pad and not giving users an option to not have it. You don't do that to loyal customers who want to use a laptop with a normal layout. Major mistake by Lenovo, hopefully soon they will be mature enough to accept their mistake and fix it. Date published: 2016-04-12

Rated 1 out of 5 by amitch81624 from Keyboard ruins a good laptop I really want to like this laptop but the off-center keyboard ruins it. Lenovo really needs to provide better options for their laptops; I want a 15.6 inch screen, with at least 2560x1440 resolution, with a centered keyboard. Why is that so hard? Instead, Lenovo provides too many different models, but none of them have what I actually want. I bought this laptop because it was the closest ThinkPad I could find to a 15.6 inch laptop with a decent display, but then when I started using it I hated the off-center keyboard because it's really annoying to always have your hands off to one side. I returned this and got the T460 instead, oh well I guess you just can't get a good 15.6 inch ThinkPad laptop from Lenovo any more. Date published: 2016-06-16

Rated 5 out of 5 by texasaggie from Great for the Right User Ignore the negative reviews if you're the right kind of user - someone that needs a superb keyboard, a numeric keypad and a trackpoint. I'm a financial analyst and was looking for a laptop that I could build complex financial models on even while sitting away from a desk and this laptop fit the ticket perfectly after much searching. I've owned 3 other Lenovo laptops in the past (including a top of the line X1 carbon) and this is my favorite one thus far in terms of features (15" display, performance, value, keyboard). Yes, it isn't as ultraportable as the X1 carbon but for the right user, you'd trade that portability for all the T560's features any day. I also added RAM on this notebook and it was easy given the strong and high quality plastics - could not have said the same for my previous Edge series Lenovo. If you can afford it - avoid the Edge series, they engineered for price so the keyboard and build quality are noticeably inferior. Date published: 2016-05-22

Rated 4 out of 5 by milleman from So close, but not quite. (Warning: I'm a product test engineer by career, so this may be lengthy and direct for some) I bought similarly configured* L560 and T560 from Lenovo.com, the T on a big sale that cost the same as the lesser L560, my intent to keep the one that suited me better and return the other. (I come from a background of classic 'T' models, the T42 and T60, that have lasted forever, which is the most important quality for any computer -- for me.) I ultimately kept the T560 mostly because if it retails more than the L it must be better, right? Well, for my needs perhaps not. Here are the shortcomings of the T560: 1) The positioning of the ports could not be worse. The Ethernet and 2 USB ports close to the front of the computer puts cables right in my way, always. The headphone jack is on the wrong side and far away. The cooling fan dumps onto my mouse hand position. 2) Why have both a miniDV and HDMI port? miniDV-to-HDMI adapters are common and cheap and miniDV is higher-rez than HDMI. We would be far better served with a 4th USB port in place of the HDMI. 3) On my machine, the infamous 220Hz PWM backlight is flickering at any brightness below 100%. I installed a script to raise the frequency up to 1000Hz, but other manufacturers, indeed other ThinkPads, don't use this fatiguing scheme. I confirmed that in fact my particular computer behaves this way. 4) Lenovo could have spent another buck to have status lights on the num lock, caps lock and wifi on/off to avoid unnecessary confusion. As well as including a battery/charge status LED by the plug like the L560 to stay aware of that with the computer shut down or sleeping. The stuff you read about is all well and good: keyboard and trackpad, build materials and assembly, lack of bloatware and useful Lenovo apps, long battery life, cool case temps, half-decent speakers, half-decent FHD display. Where the L560 better met my needs and equaled the T560 in my real-world was: 1) the port positioning was MUCH better than the T560, perhaps ideal. 2) there's a 4th USB port instead of an HDMI port, with the miniDV doing A/V duty. 3) although I was dumb to not check my machine directly, all the reports I've read suggests the L560 does not use PWM backlight dimming at all. 4) For MY needs, the L560 integral optical disc drive is essential, and will be cumbersome to buy an external ODD for the T560 and suck up another USB port. 5) Battery life, build materials and construction, keyboard, display, and all the rest all meet my needs as I'm not constantly manhandling my laptop traveling all over the country with it. It's basically a stay-at-home laptop, so any extra durability the T has over the L (slight) is wasted on me. And the L is "mil-spec" tested and probably just as robust. 6) I would have kept the L560 instead of the T560 if a keyboard backlight was available and I had the sense to confirm my L560 did not implement PWM backlight dimming. Bottom line having lived with both for months now is the T560 is everything it should be by today's standards. Not state of the art, not a great value, not a great FHD display, but generally well-designed and built, and if not carrying on the legacy of the best T Thinkpads, at least holding its own. If this can be running well like my T42 has been for a dozen years of use, it will have been a worthwhile purchase. * my configuration for both: Win10-home, i5-6200u, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, fingerprint reader, FHD IPS display, (larger battery and keyboard light on T560).

Rated 3 out of 5 by santacruzworker from Very Nice Laptop Except For... I recently upgrade to a T560 from my T530. I loved everything about the T530 except the weight. I had skipped the T540 due the horrible track pad without the buttons but decided to go with the T560 since the buttons are back. I like lighter weight of the T560 and the (1980x1080) matte touch display. With a core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, and 24GB of RAM performance is great. Over all it is a good laptop. The one thing that prevents it from being a great laptop is the awful off center keyboard. The feel of the keys is good and I like the backlight but the fact that it is off center completely ruins the user experience. I know I could have purchased a T460 and had a centered keyboard but then I would have to give up the larger display which is important to me. I do software development and the more screen real estate the better. Lenovo received a lot of complaints about the lack of track pad buttons on prior models and fixed that, but for some reason ignored the complaints about the off center keyboard. Just because the 15.5” display gives you room to cram a numeric pad on to the keyboard doesn’t mean you should. I’ll bet that for the majority of users the numeric keypad is useless. Having the keyboard off center makes my left hand hang over the edge of the palm rest which I find uncomfortable. The T530 was very comfortable to type on due to the centered keyboard. So in that respect the T530 was superior to the T560. Why Lenovo doesn’t offer the option of a centered keyboard without the numeric pad on their top of the line business laptop is beyond me. I’ll bet that the off center keyboard becomes the number one complaint for the T560. Hopefully Lenovo will eventually realize their mistake like they did with the track pad buttons and fix the keyboard in the next model. They should also do the same thing for the 15” Thinkpad Yoga, which except for the keyboard, is a very nice laptop. I would recommend to a friend that they take a look at this laptop but I'd warn them about the keyboard and tell them to make sure they are ok with it before purchasing one.

Having the keyboard off center makes my left hand hang over the edge of the palm rest which I find uncomfortable. The T530 was very comfortable to type on due to the centered keyboard. So in that respect the T530 was superior to the T560. Why Lenovo doesn’t offer the option of a centered keyboard without the numeric pad on their top of the line business laptop is beyond me. I’ll bet that the off center keyboard becomes the number one complaint for the T560. Hopefully Lenovo will eventually realize their mistake like they did with the track pad buttons and fix the keyboard in the next model. They should also do the same thing for the 15” Thinkpad Yoga, which except for the keyboard, is a very nice laptop. I would recommend to a friend that they take a look at this laptop but I'd warn them about the keyboard and tell them to make sure they are ok with it before purchasing one.

Rated 1 out of 5 by mblasko from Off-center keyboard Had been using Thinkpads for almost 20 years for work. 15'' display is my strong preference and I am ten finger typer. I have never experienced such a discomfort working with a laptop as when I have recently exchanged my T520 for new T560. Significantly off-center keyboard feels no doubt very uncomfortable and can not be compensated by added benefit of numeric pad. Lenovo, pls consider reintroducing centered keyboards for 15'' machines. Date published: 2016-08-18

Rated 3 out of 5 by jonashendrickx from Heavy, but magnificent battery life. Lenovo could have opted for a quad core processor in the ThinkPad T560, even the i7-6600U feels a bit sluggish for a laptop of this size and weight. The front bezel is a little bit loose on my machine. Aside from that you can expect a broad range of built-in enterprise features, matte touchscreen (without a film) and magnificent battery life around 18 hours. Date published: 2016-06-19

Rated 2 out of 5 by Lenovo_lover from Too heavy to be useful. This is a great laptop in every way but unfortunately it is so heavy (5.35 pounds) that it is not at all portable. Please try to introduce a lighter 15 inch version.T460s (3 pounds) and X1 carbon (2.6 pounds) are 14 inches and weigh almost HALF of this 15 inch model. I love the keyboard, touchpad and the matte screen but the 5.35 pound weight is a deal breaker. Date published: 2016-03-31

Rated 2 out of 5 by InaKrazosi from Not a laptop - more of a thigh-top What is it with numeric keypads on laptops these days? For the once-a-month that you might need it while balancing your checkbook, you end up with a keyboard that's off to the side, so you have to balance the machine and/or strain your wrists all the time. If I want a numeric keypad, I'll get a full-size keyboard. Date published: 2016-06-19

Rated 2 out of 5 by btreloar from Disappointing First Start My new T560 arrived about three weeks ago; I'm using it to replace an older T500 that's havfing some Windows 10 issues with the keyboard and trackpad/trackpoint. I love most of the features, but was mildly disappointed that the screen resolution wasn't higher than 1366x768. That's not a really big deal since I use it 90% on a ThinkPad Pro Dock with an external monitor. But THAT is where the major disappointment came in. In one office where the monitor connects via a VGA connector, there is a 1/2" black bar around all four sides of the screen that covers up the top icons on the desktop and the top line of any window that opens up against the top of the screen, blocking access to thinks like the minimize, window, and close buttons. 'In my other office, where the external monitor connects via a DVI-D connector, the monitor can't see the T560 at all. Needless to say my T500 has had no problems with either of my external monitors. Lenovo Tech support had me send the T560 back for a replacement motherboard and I'm no waiting for it to be repaired and come back. Date published: 2016-05-09

The T560 has terrible reviews onsite, involving either the keypad or weight. I rarely use the keypad on the external keyboard I use, so I would probably agree there. If there is no internal DVD drive why has the weight increased so much from the T460? Asked by: WhyT560 I dont work for Lenovo but looks like they dont answer customer questions.. is this foreshadowing? In any case, suspect that the weight comes from the increased battery capacity. The battery is perhaps the most hefty single piece of equipment inside the laptop and there are 2 of them in this one. Ill take a little heft for the extra battery life - this isnt something you will confuse with using as a tablet anyway. Answered by: Nics Date published: 2016-05-21
