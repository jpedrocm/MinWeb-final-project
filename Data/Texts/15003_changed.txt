OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. Responsive computing The  MacBook Air is powered by an Intel® Core™ i5 processor that delivers responsive, reliable computing whatever the task thanks to a capable 2.7 GHz TurboBoost clock speed. Intel® HD Graphics 6000 offers impressive visuals across media and everyday computing, so you can enjoy HD films, browsing and all of your daily tasks at their best. Multitasking and demanding processes are aided by 8 GB of RAM which, when combined with the efficiency of OS X, delivers smooth computing regardless of what you're working on. Solid state storage There's plenty of room for documents and data on the 256 GB solid state drive (SSD). With far faster transfer speeds than regular hard drives, SSDs speed up saving, booting, loading and software so you can work and play without restriction. Compact and beautifully crafted The  MacBook Air's impressively compact dimensions belie the features and design that make for a premium computing experience, including a detailed LED screen, backlit keyboard for comfortable typing in low-light conditions and a durable and stylish silver chassis. All day, everyday computing You needn't worry about running out of battery throughout the day thanks to a 12 hour active battery life, while standby mode keeps the computer primed for use for up to 30 days. If you find yourself working for long periods of time, you can do it comfortable and accurately with the backlit keyboard that automatically senses the lighting conditions and sets the light level accordingly. The multitouch trackpad features gesture control, including pinch-to-zoom, two, three and four finger swiping and inertia scrolling, which mimics iPad and iPhone scrolling for familiar and intuitive navigation. Apple connectivity The Macbook Air features Thunderbolt 2 connectivity for comprehensive monitor and TV connectivity. All you need is an adapter to connect to your preferred screen type for computing and media on a bigger screen. Two USB 3.0 ports provide high-speed connectivity to peripherals, external storage and other devices while integrated AC compatible WiFi ensures a stable connection to the web.

OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. Responsive computing The  MacBook Air is powered by an Intel® Core™ i5 processor that delivers responsive, reliable computing whatever the task thanks to a capable 2.7 GHz TurboBoost clock speed. Intel® HD Graphics 6000 offers impressive visuals across media and everyday computing, so you can enjoy HD films, browsing and all of your daily tasks at their best. Multitasking and demanding processes are aided by 8 GB of RAM which, when combined with the efficiency of OS X, delivers smooth computing regardless of what you're working on. Solid state storage There's plenty of room for documents and data on the 256 GB solid state drive (SSD). With far faster transfer speeds than regular hard drives, SSDs speed up saving, booting, loading and software so you can work and play without restriction. Compact and beautifully crafted The  MacBook Air's impressively compact dimensions belie the features and design that make for a premium computing experience, including a detailed LED screen, backlit keyboard for comfortable typing in low-light conditions and a durable and stylish silver chassis. All day, everyday computing You needn't worry about running out of battery throughout the day thanks to a 12 hour active battery life, while standby mode keeps the computer primed for use for up to 30 days. If you find yourself working for long periods of time, you can do it comfortable and accurately with the backlit keyboard that automatically senses the lighting conditions and sets the light level accordingly. The multitouch trackpad features gesture control, including pinch-to-zoom, two, three and four finger swiping and inertia scrolling, which mimics iPad and iPhone scrolling for familiar and intuitive navigation. Apple connectivity The Macbook Air features Thunderbolt 2 connectivity for comprehensive monitor and TV connectivity. All you need is an adapter to connect to your preferred screen type for computing and media on a bigger screen. Two USB 3.0 ports provide high-speed connectivity to peripherals, external storage and other devices while integrated AC compatible WiFi ensures a stable connection to the web. Fast, fun and full of features, the Apple  MacBook Air  13.3" is the perfect PC for serious computing on the move. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. Responsive computing The  MacBook Air is powered by an Intel® Core™ i5 processor that delivers responsive, reliable computing whatever the task thanks to a capable 2.7 GHz TurboBoost clock speed. Intel® HD Graphics 6000 offers impressive visuals across media and everyday computing, so you can enjoy HD films, browsing and all of your daily tasks at their best. Multitasking and demanding processes are aided by 8 GB of RAM which, when combined with the efficiency of OS X, delivers smooth computing regardless of what you're working on. Solid state storage There's plenty of room for documents and data on the 256 GB solid state drive (SSD). With far faster transfer speeds than regular hard drives, SSDs speed up saving, booting, loading and software so you can work and play without restriction. Compact and beautifully crafted The  MacBook Air's impressively compact dimensions belie the features and design that make for a premium computing experience, including a detailed LED screen, backlit keyboard for comfortable typing in low-light conditions and a durable and stylish silver chassis. All day, everyday computing You needn't worry about running out of battery throughout the day thanks to a 12 hour active battery life, while standby mode keeps the computer primed for use for up to 30 days. If you find yourself working for long periods of time, you can do it comfortable and accurately with the backlit keyboard that automatically senses the lighting conditions and sets the light level accordingly. The multitouch trackpad features gesture control, including pinch-to-zoom, two, three and four finger swiping and inertia scrolling, which mimics iPad and iPhone scrolling for familiar and intuitive navigation. Apple connectivity The Macbook Air features Thunderbolt 2 connectivity for comprehensive monitor and TV connectivity. All you need is an adapter to connect to your preferred screen type for computing and media on a bigger screen. Two USB 3.0 ports provide high-speed connectivity to peripherals, external storage and other devices while integrated AC compatible WiFi ensures a stable connection to the web. Fast, fun and full of features, the Apple  MacBook Air  13.3" is the perfect PC for serious computing on the move. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
