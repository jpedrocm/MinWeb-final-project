Laptop mode to work Write your paper or update your blog while listening to your favorite songs. Tablet mode to go Check your newsfeed, read a book and browse on-the-go.1 Take it anywhere Thin, light and great battery life, so your laptop can go wherever you go. Thin just got thinner Designed with a smaller hinge, this is our thinnest, lightest Pavilion x360 ever. Starting at under 3lbs and less than 20mm thin, it's up to 14% thinner than before.2 Quality performance Life can be unpredictable, but your HP laptop shouldn't be. We designed a hinge that moves as fluidly the thousandth time you open it as it does the first time. The stainless steel hinge is tested with up to 25,000 openings and closings and 7,000 360-degree rotations. Sealing the mechanism in metal helps keep dirt and dust out, so the enclosed gear hinge isn't vulnerable to damage from the elements.3 Liberating battery life Leave the cord behind and take on the day with up to 9 hours and 15 minutes of battery life.4 Bye-bye, outlet.
