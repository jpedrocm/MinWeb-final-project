It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Premium portable workstation The Surface Book is a high-end PC designed for professional creative use. From editing films to recording music, it enables you work at your best wherever you are. The screen rotates around the keyboard or can be removed completely, so you can use the Surface Book as a laptop or tablet, or prop it up to watch films in comfort. Made for creative computing Whatever you're working on you can expect crisp lines and bright, natural colours thanks to the Pixel Density Display and dedicated NVIDIA graphics card. It's ideal for graphic design as the screen has a resolution 4x sharper than that of a normal laptop. This makes precise editing and drawing much easier and ensures your followers or clients see exactly the same thing you do. Serious Intel® Core® processing The powerful Intel® Core™ i7 processor is seriously fast and runs the most demanding creative software quickly and smoothly. You can set up a professional studio anywhere and work on projects using industry-standard design suites like Adobe Creative Cloud without compromising on performance. Create your way with the Surface Pen The Surface Pen makes drawing quick, accurate, and intuitive. Whether you're annotating essays, editing images in Photoshop, or designing in AutoCAD, it gives you the pin-point precision to create professional documents without the need for an additional graphics tablet.

Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Top features: - Beautifully crafted chassis is cut from a single piece of aluminium - Ultra HD screen is detailed enough for professional graphic design and photo editing - Powerful Intel® Core™ i7 processor runs the most demanding software flawlessly - Surface Pen lets you write and draw on the screen just like paper Create This laptop is part of our Create range, so you be certain that it has the power to help you bring your ideas to life. It's specially designed for graphic design, music production, photo editing, and film making.  Premium portable workstation The Surface Book is a high-end PC designed for professional creative use. From editing films to recording music, it enables you work at your best wherever you are. The screen rotates around the keyboard or can be removed completely, so you can use the Surface Book as a laptop or tablet, or prop it up to watch films in comfort. Made for creative computing Whatever you're working on you can expect crisp lines and bright, natural colours thanks to the Pixel Density Display and dedicated NVIDIA graphics card. It's ideal for graphic design as the screen has a resolution 4x sharper than that of a normal laptop. This makes precise editing and drawing much easier and ensures your followers or clients see exactly the same thing you do. Serious Intel® Core® processing The powerful Intel® Core™ i7 processor is seriously fast and runs the most demanding creative software quickly and smoothly. You can set up a professional studio anywhere and work on projects using industry-standard design suites like Adobe Creative Cloud without compromising on performance. Create your way with the Surface Pen The Surface Pen makes drawing quick, accurate, and intuitive. Whether you're annotating essays, editing images in Photoshop, or designing in AutoCAD, it gives you the pin-point precision to create professional documents without the need for an additional graphics tablet.
