Wyse X90cw 11.6" LED Notebook - Intel Atom Z520 Single-core (1 Core) 1.33 GHz Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A The sleek Wyse X90cw mobile thin client features the benefits of other Wyse virtual clients, but in a form factor ideal for the mobile worker. Because the Wyse X90cw mobile thin client has no hard drives and no server-side data stored on the device, these devices are highly secure. That means that mobile workers no longer have to worry as much about exposure of sensitive data to insecure environments. As all data is stored and accessed remotely, the risk of data loss through stolen or mislaid laptops is eliminated.
