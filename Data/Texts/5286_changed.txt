FPO 4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture—not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

FPO 4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture—not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

FPO 4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture—not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

FPO 4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture—not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.

4K resolution7 What is 4K? 4K is the next evolution of high-definition images. 4K displays can produce much sharper, clearer, more vibrant on-screen images. That's because the screen resolution and pixel count are higher than your typical HD monitor. Basically, the more pixels you have, the sharper the image appears. And 4K has over 8 million pixels, roughly four times as many as Full HD. Now that's sharp. The 4K difference 4K is so sharp, you can't help but get drawn into the clear picture. And that's okay, because the image won't break down and appear blurry even when you're a foot away from the screen. No matter how close you get, you'll see the picture—not the pixels. And if you're into editing high-res pictures and video, your creativity just got a whole lot sharper. The evolution of 4K 4K began as a standardized spec film studios could use to create the next generation of big-screen experiences. But it goes beyond Hollywood; the 4K revolution is taking over everything from television to smartphones. Soon, the world will be seen in 4K, and our pictures will be clearer and sharper than ever.
