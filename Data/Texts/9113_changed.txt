The 38.4Wh 6-cell integrated battery lasts up to 8 hours. (Battery life varies depending upon configuration and use.) Thin and Light for Doers on the Go Thin and light laptops usually bear a hefty price tag, but the affordable N20p Chromebook is just over a half of an inch thin and weighs in at just 3 pounds. Full-Sized Keyboard With Touchpad The acclaimed AccuType keyboard is ergonomically designed to make typing more comfortable and to reduce errors. The intuitive, easy-to-use touchpad features simple scroll, zoom, and rotate functions.
