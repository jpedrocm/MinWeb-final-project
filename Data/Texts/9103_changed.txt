Initiated a return 10 days ago, have heard nothing from Lenovo. Ordered a new model, same problem. Trying to return it too. I've purchase literally dozens of Thinkpads since 1995. This is junk. Date published: 2016-01-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by natto_99 from Portable workstation I purchase E460 a few months ago. The machine is fast and easy to use. Because of the light weight, it is easy to bring around. This is a great machine with balance. Date published: 2016-08-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by ThinkingMonkey from A very good work laptop I bought 3 of the Thinkpad E460 for work. So far they have been great at keeping up with the legacy of Thinkpad build quality etc. Performance has been great. Pros: Build quality. Performance.Value. Reliability.

Initiated a return 10 days ago, have heard nothing from Lenovo. Ordered a new model, same problem. Trying to return it too. I've purchase literally dozens of Thinkpads since 1995. This is junk. Date published: 2016-01-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by natto_99 from Portable workstation I purchase E460 a few months ago. The machine is fast and easy to use. Because of the light weight, it is easy to bring around. This is a great machine with balance. Date published: 2016-08-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by ThinkingMonkey from A very good work laptop I bought 3 of the Thinkpad E460 for work. So far they have been great at keeping up with the legacy of Thinkpad build quality etc. Performance has been great. Pros: Build quality. Performance.Value. Reliability. Cons (nitpicking): The trackpad rubber cap comes out often. Screen viewing angles can be better.

Rated 1 out of 5 by DAAA from Quality Stinks I bought an e455 just before Christmas, unit showed up and first three uses, blue screen of death. Initiated a return 10 days ago, have heard nothing from Lenovo. Ordered a new model, same problem. Trying to return it too. I've purchase literally dozens of Thinkpads since 1995. This is junk. Date published: 2016-01-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by natto_99 from Portable workstation I purchase E460 a few months ago. The machine is fast and easy to use. Because of the light weight, it is easy to bring around. This is a great machine with balance. Date published: 2016-08-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by ThinkingMonkey from A very good work laptop I bought 3 of the Thinkpad E460 for work. So far they have been great at keeping up with the legacy of Thinkpad build quality etc. Performance has been great. Pros: Build quality. Performance.Value. Reliability. Cons (nitpicking): The trackpad rubber cap comes out often. Screen viewing angles can be better.
