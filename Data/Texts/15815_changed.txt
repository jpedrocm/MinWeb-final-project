Whether you're writing an essay, updating social media, or anything else you do throughout the day, you can work wherever you are with complete control and comfort using the full-size keyboard.

Samsung AMOLED screen From media editing and design to streaming TV on demand, you can expect impressive visuals thanks to Samsung's AMOLED screen. It has a resolution higher than most Full HD TVs, so you aren't compromising on quality when you're watching away from home. Intel® Performance Performance comes from the latest Intel™ Core® M processor. During everyday computing the Core™ M processor runs with maximum energy efficiency to give you longer between charges - up to ten and half hours between charges. When you need more power for demanding tasks such as photo editing or managing a database, the processor instantly increases the performance to give you the speed you need to work at your best. Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Pro gives you features focussed towards professional users, including remote desktop control and Hyper-V, which lets you run and switch between two operating systems. If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, which makes finding your software and folders simple if you're coming from Windows XP or 7. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Xbox One streaming Don't miss out on gaming if the living room TV has been taken up by sports or soaps with Xbox One streaming.

It connects to the internet the same way you smartphone does, so you can get online even if there isn't a WiFi connection available - ideal for travelling, working on the commute, or if you can't get broadband in your area. 2 in 1 computing             The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S features a removable keyboard to give you the benefit of both laptop and tablet computing from a single, versatile device. Whether you're writing an essay, updating social media, or anything else you do throughout the day, you can work wherever you are with complete control and comfort using the full-size keyboard. If you're reading an eBook or watching a film, you can pop the keyboard off to enjoy it in comfort. Samsung AMOLED screen From media editing and design to streaming TV on demand, you can expect impressive visuals thanks to Samsung's AMOLED screen. It has a resolution higher than most Full HD TVs, so you aren't compromising on quality when you're watching away from home. Intel® Performance Performance comes from the latest Intel™ Core® M processor. During everyday computing the Core™ M processor runs with maximum energy efficiency to give you longer between charges - up to ten and half hours between charges. When you need more power for demanding tasks such as photo editing or managing a database, the processor instantly increases the performance to give you the speed you need to work at your best. Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Pro gives you features focussed towards professional users, including remote desktop control and Hyper-V, which lets you run and switch between two operating systems. If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, which makes finding your software and folders simple if you're coming from Windows XP or 7. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Xbox One streaming Don't miss out on gaming if the living room TV has been taken up by sports or soaps with Xbox One streaming. As long as you're using the same WiFi connection as your Xbox One, you can use the TabPro S as a monitor for versatile gaming in any room. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Highlights - Portable 2 in 1 tablet / laptop combines performance and everyday usability - Better-than-HD screen displays impressive images with bright colours and high detail - Intelligent Intel® Core™ M processor delivers both high performance and efficiency - Windows 10 Pro gives you complete PC productivity and allows you to stream Xbox One games to the tablet - 10.5 hour battery life lets you work all day without working 4G connectivity This version of the Galaxy TabPro S features a SIM card slot for 4G connectivity, which gives you access the internet from almost anywhere in the country. It connects to the internet the same way you smartphone does, so you can get online even if there isn't a WiFi connection available - ideal for travelling, working on the commute, or if you can't get broadband in your area. 2 in 1 computing             The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S features a removable keyboard to give you the benefit of both laptop and tablet computing from a single, versatile device. Whether you're writing an essay, updating social media, or anything else you do throughout the day, you can work wherever you are with complete control and comfort using the full-size keyboard. If you're reading an eBook or watching a film, you can pop the keyboard off to enjoy it in comfort. Samsung AMOLED screen From media editing and design to streaming TV on demand, you can expect impressive visuals thanks to Samsung's AMOLED screen. It has a resolution higher than most Full HD TVs, so you aren't compromising on quality when you're watching away from home. Intel® Performance Performance comes from the latest Intel™ Core® M processor. During everyday computing the Core™ M processor runs with maximum energy efficiency to give you longer between charges - up to ten and half hours between charges. When you need more power for demanding tasks such as photo editing or managing a database, the processor instantly increases the performance to give you the speed you need to work at your best. Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Pro gives you features focussed towards professional users, including remote desktop control and Hyper-V, which lets you run and switch between two operating systems. If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, which makes finding your software and folders simple if you're coming from Windows XP or 7. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks.

When you need more power for demanding tasks such as photo editing or managing a database, the processor instantly increases the performance to give you the speed you need to work at your best. Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Pro gives you features focussed towards professional users, including remote desktop control and Hyper-V, which lets you run and switch between two operating systems. If you're an experienced Windows user you'll be pleased with the return of the familiar Start button and menu, which makes finding your software and folders simple if you're coming from Windows XP or 7. Working between different software or keeping an eye on social media while you work has never been easier; you can now snap up to four apps to any location on the screen for effortless multitasking. You can even create individual desktops for specific projects and tasks. Xbox One streaming Don't miss out on gaming if the living room TV has been taken up by sports or soaps with Xbox One streaming. As long as you're using the same WiFi connection as your Xbox One, you can use the TabPro S as a monitor for versatile gaming in any room. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
