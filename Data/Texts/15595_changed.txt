You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 10 Product information Highlights - Seriously slim case makes this the lightest and most portable MacBook ever - A single USB-C port combines device input, power and video output for simple connectivity - The New Force Touch trackpad makes navigation faster and more intuitive than ever - Fanless design and ten hour battery life let you work all day without being disturbed - AC WiFi gives you faster, more stable internet connectivity so you can make the most of Cloud computing Comprehensive computing wherever you are At just 13.1 mm thick and weighing a mere 900 grams, the Apple MacBook is made for computing on the move. You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Highlights - Seriously slim case makes this the lightest and most portable MacBook ever - A single USB-C port combines device input, power and video output for simple connectivity - The New Force Touch trackpad makes navigation faster and more intuitive than ever - Fanless design and ten hour battery life let you work all day without being disturbed - AC WiFi gives you faster, more stable internet connectivity so you can make the most of Cloud computing Comprehensive computing wherever you are At just 13.1 mm thick and weighing a mere 900 grams, the Apple MacBook is made for computing on the move. You can drop it into a bag or case and enjoy access to everything that matters without compromising luggage space. The ten hour battery life means you can work all day between charging. If you do need to top up, simply connect a USB-C cable to the MacBook. USB-C is the next-generation of PC connectivity, and allows you to connect monitors, external storage, peripherals and more. OS X El Capitan is fully Cloud integrated, so you can forget hunting for memory sticks and carrying external storage with you. You can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and access to important documents from anywhere. Force Touch Trackpad The MacBook 12 features Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clicks simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. Intel® Core™ M processing One of the reasons the new MacBook manages to be so slim is the Intel® Core™ M processor. It's much more compact than other processors and doesn't need fan cooling, so there are no noisy and unsightly vents to affect the size and shape of the all-aluminium body. It's quick too, and is the ideal processor for everyday work, surfing and fun. Packed full of performance and high-end features including a better-than-HD screen and super fast SSD storage, the new MacBook is the ultimate Apple laptop for computing on-the-go. OS X El Capitan The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive El Capitan operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of El Capitan, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
