I already knew of the Thinkpad series from an older machine I had owned in the past, of its wonderful build quality. The Thinkpad t460 is a wonderful match for me, with my build of it including a core i5 processor, 8GB ram, a 256 GB SSD, and the standard dual battery system. That was the experience I was looking for; something that would pack a decent punch without draining the battery in a matter of an hour. I had been already satisfied with what I had expected out of the Thinkpad t460, but the little finishing touches that Lenovo has included on it bring this rating up to five stars. The keyboard is the closest to feeling like a mechanical keyboard on a laptop that I have used, not at all mushy with a respectable travel distance despite being on a laptop. The keyboard also has an FnLk button, which seems a bit pointless at first, but if you use it like a caps-lock for the fn keys it makes using browser functions like searching for a key word or using full screen much easier. The mute function buttons have orange led to let you know if they are enabled or not. Speaking of nicely placed leds the Thinkpad logo on the back of the screen conceals an led that uses a breathing effect to let you know if it is asleep or not, something I have not seen done before. The user experience alone could sell this machine but the power and performance make it worth the price tag. One thing I have neglected to mention is acoustics, which, with an SSD, are silent as a mouse under normal load. I have not heard the fan at all which is good, but fear not, the fan is working on my machine. I could rant more on the great features of the machine, but I think you the reader has gotten my point. I have also included images of my t460 to help with my review. Date published: 2016-08-10 Rated 5 out of 5 by ClackTech from Another Great Thinkpad for Work I ordered mine with the i5 6200, 8GB RAM, 6wh rear battery, and Windows 7 (for certain software we use), and a 512GB SSD. I owned a Thinkpad x230i prior to this, and have purchased and setup MANY Thinkpad models for my clients. This laptop has thus far greatly impressed me with it being lighter than my last ThinkPad (which had a smaller screen), the battery life, and the efficiency. The frame feels very durable, the screen is vibrant, the sound is clear, and the keyboard is more comfortable to type on since the area to rest your wrists is larger than the x230i I was previously using. Be sure to ALWAYS order with an SSD installed. If you're on the fence between a 12" and the 14", get this model. Date published: 2016-03-07 Rated 5 out of 5 by Slim Jim from Perfect laptop I can't think of one thing I would change about it. The i7 processor uses a very small amount of power and that helps the laptop's battery last forever (the optional 6 cell battery is amazing). The keyboard and trackpad feel great and the frame is sturdy. I think the 14 inch screen size is perfect and easy to transport as well. The 24gb of RAM on this specific configuration can handle anything I throw at it. Nothing about the T460 feels cheap or sub par and I have no complaints. There isn't even any bloatware which has been on every other device I have ever purchased. Lenovo didn't cut any corners when making this which is rare in the tech world.

Asked by: Haval I would go with the i5 the one that they give you is only dual core so you will not see any improvement and your battery will last longer with an i5. people will say that you are using multiple programs you will need an i7 but there will be no improvement in your case because those programs don't use a lot of recourses.

I already knew of the Thinkpad series from an older machine I had owned in the past, of its wonderful build quality. The Thinkpad t460 is a wonderful match for me, with my build of it including a core i5 processor, 8GB ram, a 256 GB SSD, and the standard dual battery system. That was the experience I was looking for; something that would pack a decent punch without draining the battery in a matter of an hour. I had been already satisfied with what I had expected out of the Thinkpad t460, but the little finishing touches that Lenovo has included on it bring this rating up to five stars. The keyboard is the closest to feeling like a mechanical keyboard on a laptop that I have used, not at all mushy with a respectable travel distance despite being on a laptop. The keyboard also has an FnLk button, which seems a bit pointless at first, but if you use it like a caps-lock for the fn keys it makes using browser functions like searching for a key word or using full screen much easier. The mute function buttons have orange led to let you know if they are enabled or not. Speaking of nicely placed leds the Thinkpad logo on the back of the screen conceals an led that uses a breathing effect to let you know if it is asleep or not, something I have not seen done before. The user experience alone could sell this machine but the power and performance make it worth the price tag. One thing I have neglected to mention is acoustics, which, with an SSD, are silent as a mouse under normal load. I have not heard the fan at all which is good, but fear not, the fan is working on my machine. I could rant more on the great features of the machine, but I think you the reader has gotten my point. I have also included images of my t460 to help with my review. Date published: 2016-08-10 Rated 5 out of 5 by ClackTech from Another Great Thinkpad for Work I ordered mine with the i5 6200, 8GB RAM, 6wh rear battery, and Windows 7 (for certain software we use), and a 512GB SSD. I owned a Thinkpad x230i prior to this, and have purchased and setup MANY Thinkpad models for my clients. This laptop has thus far greatly impressed me with it being lighter than my last ThinkPad (which had a smaller screen), the battery life, and the efficiency. The frame feels very durable, the screen is vibrant, the sound is clear, and the keyboard is more comfortable to type on since the area to rest your wrists is larger than the x230i I was previously using. Be sure to ALWAYS order with an SSD installed. If you're on the fence between a 12" and the 14", get this model. Date published: 2016-03-07 Rated 5 out of 5 by Slim Jim from Perfect laptop I can't think of one thing I would change about it. The i7 processor uses a very small amount of power and that helps the laptop's battery last forever (the optional 6 cell battery is amazing). The keyboard and trackpad feel great and the frame is sturdy. I think the 14 inch screen size is perfect and easy to transport as well. The 24gb of RAM on this specific configuration can handle anything I throw at it. Nothing about the T460 feels cheap or sub par and I have no complaints. There isn't even any bloatware which has been on every other device I have ever purchased. Lenovo didn't cut any corners when making this which is rare in the tech world.

Asked by: Haval I would go with the i5 the one that they give you is only dual core so you will not see any improvement and your battery will last longer with an i5. people will say that you are using multiple programs you will need an i7 but there will be no improvement in your case because those programs don't use a lot of recourses.

Rated 5 out of 5 by whatthe4355 from An excellent machine that is built to last I will start off with the reason I bought this laptop, I needed something to last me through college as a daily use laptop for about 6 years. I already knew of the Thinkpad series from an older machine I had owned in the past, of its wonderful build quality. The Thinkpad t460 is a wonderful match for me, with my build of it including a core i5 processor, 8GB ram, a 256 GB SSD, and the standard dual battery system. That was the experience I was looking for; something that would pack a decent punch without draining the battery in a matter of an hour. I had been already satisfied with what I had expected out of the Thinkpad t460, but the little finishing touches that Lenovo has included on it bring this rating up to five stars. The keyboard is the closest to feeling like a mechanical keyboard on a laptop that I have used, not at all mushy with a respectable travel distance despite being on a laptop. The keyboard also has an FnLk button, which seems a bit pointless at first, but if you use it like a caps-lock for the fn keys it makes using browser functions like searching for a key word or using full screen much easier. The mute function buttons have orange led to let you know if they are enabled or not. Speaking of nicely placed leds the Thinkpad logo on the back of the screen conceals an led that uses a breathing effect to let you know if it is asleep or not, something I have not seen done before. The user experience alone could sell this machine but the power and performance make it worth the price tag. One thing I have neglected to mention is acoustics, which, with an SSD, are silent as a mouse under normal load. I have not heard the fan at all which is good, but fear not, the fan is working on my machine. I could rant more on the great features of the machine, but I think you the reader has gotten my point. I have also included images of my t460 to help with my review. Date published: 2016-08-10 Rated 5 out of 5 by ClackTech from Another Great Thinkpad for Work I ordered mine with the i5 6200, 8GB RAM, 6wh rear battery, and Windows 7 (for certain software we use), and a 512GB SSD. I owned a Thinkpad x230i prior to this, and have purchased and setup MANY Thinkpad models for my clients. This laptop has thus far greatly impressed me with it being lighter than my last ThinkPad (which had a smaller screen), the battery life, and the efficiency. The frame feels very durable, the screen is vibrant, the sound is clear, and the keyboard is more comfortable to type on since the area to rest your wrists is larger than the x230i I was previously using. Be sure to ALWAYS order with an SSD installed. If you're on the fence between a 12" and the 14", get this model. Date published: 2016-03-07 Rated 5 out of 5 by Slim Jim from Perfect laptop I can't think of one thing I would change about it. The i7 processor uses a very small amount of power and that helps the laptop's battery last forever (the optional 6 cell battery is amazing). The keyboard and trackpad feel great and the frame is sturdy. I think the 14 inch screen size is perfect and easy to transport as well. The 24gb of RAM on this specific configuration can handle anything I throw at it. Nothing about the T460 feels cheap or sub par and I have no complaints. There isn't even any bloatware which has been on every other device I have ever purchased. Lenovo didn't cut any corners when making this which is rare in the tech world.
