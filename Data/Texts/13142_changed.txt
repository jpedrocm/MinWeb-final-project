Larger and Smarter Touchpad The larger 106mm x 74mm touchpads found on the X Series have a palm rejection feature which differentiates between actual fingertip and palm contact to counter unintentional cursor movement. Stays Cool, Even After Hours of Use ASUS IceCool Technology gives X Series a unique internal design that addresses uncomfortable heating issues by preventing heat build-up under the palm rest. This keeps the palm rest surface between 28°C to 35°C – significantly lower than body temperature. This exclusive internal layout places heat producing components away from you, and when combined with exceptional cooling from the heat pipes and vents, ensures you stay comfortable even after long hours of use.

Large touchpad, chiclet keyboard with numeric keypad and HDMI are all part of the package, along with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for easy pairing with your portable devices. Expressive Colors. Stunning Finishes. Designed for daily computing, the stylish ASUS X Series comes in multiple expressive colors and a variety of textured finishes to make sure you stand out from the crowd. Asus X Series feature elegant glossy, spun- or premium brushed-metal-effect finish chassis and are available in five expressive colors: Chocolate Brown, Navy Blue, Arctic Snow, Glamour Red, and Icicle Gold. Uncompromising Performance ASUS X Series laptops are powered by the latest 6th-generation Intel Core i7 processor with up to 8GB RAM (expandable to 16GB), and NVIDIA GeForce GT 940MX graphics. With Windows 10 preinstalled, X Series is ideal for daily computing and entertainment tasks. Users can opt for a 2TB hard disk, or upgrade to a solid-state disk for faster data access speeds. Amazing NVIDIA Discrete Graphics ASUS X Series boasts up to NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics, to give it the visual prowess to tackle graphically-demanding tasks with ease. Watch a movie, play the latest games, or edit photos and videos – do it all with the X Series. Faster and Easier Connections with USB Type-C ASUS X Series gives you a wide array of connectivity options that include USB 3.0 Type-C, HDMI and VGA ports, a 3-in-1 SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, and more to ensure compatibility with various peripherals and devices. The reversible USB Type-C port ensures a proper connection every time, right-side up, or upside down. USB Type-C gives you data transmission speeds of up to 5Gbit/s – almost 10 times that of USB 2.0. You can transfer photos, music, and even large video files in a fraction of the time. Enjoy a World of Color with ASUS Splendid Technology To ensure only the very best images, exclusive ASUS Splendid Technology has color temperature correction to reproduce richer, deeper colors. It features four visuals modes which can be accessed with a single click. Vivid Mode optimizes contrast for browsing photos or watching videos and movies; Eye Care Mode reduces blue light levels and is ideal when you're reading for long hours. Normal Mode has been tuned for daily tasks; while Manual Mode is for advanced color adjustments. ASUS X Series laptops can be specced up to a Full HD (1920x 1080) resolution display, you'll enjoy rich detailed images onscreen. Protect Your Eyes with ASUS Eye Care Most LED panels emit blue light - the main cause of macular degeneration and retinal problems. ASUS Eye Care mode effectively reduces blue light levels by up to 33% to make reading comfortable, and to protect you from potential eye fatigue and other ailments. Expansive Audio, Tuned by Experts A mixture of hardware, software, and tuning, SonicMaster was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. A professional codec ensures precise sound performance; while an optimized amplifier, larger speakers and resonance chambers deliver powerful audio output and deeper bass. Additional signal processing helps fine tune the hardware, filtering noise and improving clarity so you can enjoy unrivalled audio on your X Series. AudioWizard-Optimized Tuning AudioWizard helps you fine tune your audio through six pre-set modes. Its simple and intuitive interface lets you switch instantly between these modes to get the best audio for any content, in any environment. Or if you prefer, take full control of settings manually. Music mode brings your favorite songs to life, while Movie mode gives you cinema-quality audio. Recording mode optimizes settings so you get crystal-clear recording. Gaming mode fully immerses you in the game, while Speech mode ensures clearer dialogue. Ergonomic Keyboard Design Typing is now more comfortable than ever with the X Series' full-size one-piece chiclet keyboard. An improved back-assembly provides 1.8mm of key travel and minimal key float, so you get a more solid typing feel. Intuitive ASUS Smart Gesture Input ASUS Smart Gesture technology utilizes an intelligent combination of hardware and software optimization to give you precise input. Sophisticated smartphone touchscreen production methods result in a highly sensitive touch pad that allows you to pinch-zoom in and out, or scroll through images and webpages with ease. Larger and Smarter Touchpad The larger 106mm x 74mm touchpads found on the X Series have a palm rejection feature which differentiates between actual fingertip and palm contact to counter unintentional cursor movement. Stays Cool, Even After Hours of Use ASUS IceCool Technology gives X Series a unique internal design that addresses uncomfortable heating issues by preventing heat build-up under the palm rest. This keeps the palm rest surface between 28°C to 35°C – significantly lower than body temperature. This exclusive internal layout places heat producing components away from you, and when combined with exceptional cooling from the heat pipes and vents, ensures you stay comfortable even after long hours of use.

Expansive Audio, Tuned by Experts A mixture of hardware, software, and tuning, SonicMaster was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. A professional codec ensures precise sound performance; while an optimized amplifier, larger speakers and resonance chambers deliver powerful audio output and deeper bass. Additional signal processing helps fine tune the hardware, filtering noise and improving clarity so you can enjoy unrivalled audio on your X Series. AudioWizard-Optimized Tuning AudioWizard helps you fine tune your audio through six pre-set modes. Its simple and intuitive interface lets you switch instantly between these modes to get the best audio for any content, in any environment. Or if you prefer, take full control of settings manually. Music mode brings your favorite songs to life, while Movie mode gives you cinema-quality audio. Recording mode optimizes settings so you get crystal-clear recording. Gaming mode fully immerses you in the game, while Speech mode ensures clearer dialogue. Ergonomic Keyboard Design Typing is now more comfortable than ever with the X Series' full-size one-piece chiclet keyboard. An improved back-assembly provides 1.8mm of key travel and minimal key float, so you get a more solid typing feel. Intuitive ASUS Smart Gesture Input ASUS Smart Gesture technology utilizes an intelligent combination of hardware and software optimization to give you precise input. Sophisticated smartphone touchscreen production methods result in a highly sensitive touch pad that allows you to pinch-zoom in and out, or scroll through images and webpages with ease. Larger and Smarter Touchpad The larger 106mm x 74mm touchpads found on the X Series have a palm rejection feature which differentiates between actual fingertip and palm contact to counter unintentional cursor movement. Stays Cool, Even After Hours of Use ASUS IceCool Technology gives X Series a unique internal design that addresses uncomfortable heating issues by preventing heat build-up under the palm rest. This keeps the palm rest surface between 28°C to 35°C – significantly lower than body temperature. This exclusive internal layout places heat producing components away from you, and when combined with exceptional cooling from the heat pipes and vents, ensures you stay comfortable even after long hours of use.
