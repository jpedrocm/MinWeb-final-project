Intel Enhanced SpeedStep® Technology Now get even more performance enhancing, energy conserving benefits from Intel. With SpeedStep technology, your processor simultaneously switches voltage and frequency to high or low levels depending on processor load. Enhanced SpeedStep technology performs voltage and frequency changes separately so the system performs better with reduced latency due to system unavailability. Thermal Monitoring Technologies This feature is designed to protect the processor in the event of unusual circumstances such as cooling fan failure which can cause damage if internal chassis temperatures become higher than normal. It works by reducing the processor's power consumption if the programmed thermal temperature is exceeded. The processor contains a thermal diode which measures the actual CPU temperature and relays its temperature and thermal requirements to the motherboard. The motherboard uses those requirements to control the processor fan and ensure it does not spin faster than necessary - even under worst case power use.

Thermal Monitoring Technologies This feature is designed to protect the processor in the event of unusual circumstances such as cooling fan failure which can cause damage if internal chassis temperatures become higher than normal. It works by reducing the processor's power consumption if the programmed thermal temperature is exceeded. The processor contains a thermal diode which measures the actual CPU temperature and relays its temperature and thermal requirements to the motherboard. The motherboard uses those requirements to control the processor fan and ensure it does not spin faster than necessary - even under worst case power use.
