Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by dakota95 The Best of the Best BUT Disappointing Battery I used this notebook for a little under a month and loved every minute it was powered on. The notebook has the best build quality I've ever felt, better than a macbook. It was always fast and responsive even under pressure. The 1080 screen is crisp and very bright. The speakers were underwhelming, not bad, just not a what I was expecting with the hype from a big name like B&O. Now then, the DISAPPOINTMENTS. The battery is terrible and under almost no circumstances will you get the advertised 13 hours of battery life. The first 2 days the battery last 3 and 4 hours respectively, and then I called tech support. Tech support updated the bios and told me the battery life I was receiving was normal. The next day the battery lasted 6 hours. But I don't think it had much to do with the bios update, I think I just used less demanding tasks. So in a quest to achieve a better battery I tweaked some settings, turning down the processor to only 70%, kept the brightness down below 40% and even turned off wifi for a large portion of the day. After all that the battery still only lasted about 6 for the remainder of my time with the notebook. Notice how I said in ALMOST no circumstances you will get the advertised battery, that is because the people I spoke to in tech support told me that I could achieve that time if I didn't used the notebook. With this new information in hand and new power saver settings, I left the notebook on a desk powered on and set to never turn off the screen. I powered it on at 11:00AM and it stayed on until 5:00AM the next day, that's 18 hours. So assuming you don't plan on using the notebook, perhaps you just want it as an art piece or paper weight for you desk, you aren't going to get the advertised battery life. I decided that even though I loved the beauty of the notebook I made the decision to return it and instead purchased a macbook air that on the first day of use lasted 11 hours and 57 minutes, and every day after that has out performed the Spectre's battery with the average being 10 hours of time on, even with the screen set to 90% brightness. So you just need to decide how you'll be using the notebook and if you need a long battery, if not I would definitely recommend this notebook, otherwise I'd pass. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by richard65 Pretty good device I have had this laptop now for a few months. I needed to replace another HP laptop which was stolen when I was traveling. I must say that I haven't found any problems so far; it has worked as advertised without any glitches. I like the convertible hinge and being able to use it more as a tablet. It is reasonably fast and the screen is good. I have watched many movies on Netflix; the sound is good, but I usually wear headphones. It connects to a TV with the HDMI connector. I was looking for a device with sufficient connectors, USB, etc and think this is a good compromise. The problem with lighter devices is that they have limited ability to connect things. I have been very happy with this laptop and hope it isn't stolen. May 14, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by OriTux Still Not Enough The specifications on this computer are in-line with what you would expect an ultrabook at this price to be. However, it lacks DDR4 RAM when it clearly is capable of handling it. HP cut a corner there. In addition, HP does not offer NVMe PCIe SSDs on this laptop. This is pretty much a flagship device and the lack of PCIe standard SSD is disappointing. The processor and RAM performance is pretty much identical to any other device that contains these specs. The keyboard and touchpad are both very good. There is a good amount of travel on the keyboards and the response is quick. Typing is quick and accurate. The extra wide touch pad makes using it a breeze and I honestly do not see why people think MacBook touchpads are significantly or even marginally better. The inclusion of a touchscreen means you have another option for input although the screen will move when you touch it. The hinge is not as tight as I would like it. There are plenty of ports and there is absolutely nothing to complain about. Heavy for tablet use so don't buy this if you think of procuring a 2-in-1. This is more of a laptop with touch. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by sumitmcc Amazing performance for the price I am definitely impresses by the device. I used HP envy 4 series ultrabook before and have tried some latest ultrabooks of DELL and Lenovo (XPS and Yoga Pro 3) recently and switching to this device is a choice I will never regret for sure. Pros: 1. Amazing looks! Catches attention everywhere you go. First they start comparing it to MacBook and then see it, use it and come out saying it is better than MacBook which is no exaggeration. 2. Touchscreen - yes, maybe not that essential in short term but try using Microsoft word on touchscreen and you will know why I love it (especially if you aren't a pro typist) 3. SSD - Yes, this fact cant be highlighted more. OFF to home screen in 2.5 seconds!!!! 4. Brilliant sound - Bang and Olufsen have totally nailed it with the sound quality. It is totally pleasant and also maintains the loudness - something that other brands don't focus much on 5. Battery - the fact that it gives 10 -11 hours straight is itself a compelling factor to buy it. And I am totally satisfied with that performance 6. Customer service - I have to give it to HP for this. The price of laptop reduced by 150$ in a week after I purchased. I contacted the customer care if I can get the refund for the difference. It was facilitated with no hassle! Cons - 1. Screen - the more you use the touchscreen, more it keeps accumulating the fingerprints. SO u need to wipe it frequently to make it look clean or buy a screenguard 2. headphone port - the headphone and mic port are integrated and the default play device is the laptop speakers. So if u are on skype or viber for calling then you have to change the default communications and playback device to headphone everytime which is kind of irritating 3. addictive - you just cant stop using the ultrabook, the more you use it, the more you feel the need to use it. If you are in university with friends then it is difficult to keept it away from friends ;-) All in all, I am totally happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who is planning to buy one. But if you are a gamer then this is not the right one for you.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by dakota95 The Best of the Best BUT Disappointing Battery I used this notebook for a little under a month and loved every minute it was powered on. The notebook has the best build quality I've ever felt, better than a macbook. It was always fast and responsive even under pressure. The 1080 screen is crisp and very bright. The speakers were underwhelming, not bad, just not a what I was expecting with the hype from a big name like B&O. Now then, the DISAPPOINTMENTS. The battery is terrible and under almost no circumstances will you get the advertised 13 hours of battery life. The first 2 days the battery last 3 and 4 hours respectively, and then I called tech support. Tech support updated the bios and told me the battery life I was receiving was normal. The next day the battery lasted 6 hours. But I don't think it had much to do with the bios update, I think I just used less demanding tasks. So in a quest to achieve a better battery I tweaked some settings, turning down the processor to only 70%, kept the brightness down below 40% and even turned off wifi for a large portion of the day. After all that the battery still only lasted about 6 for the remainder of my time with the notebook. Notice how I said in ALMOST no circumstances you will get the advertised battery, that is because the people I spoke to in tech support told me that I could achieve that time if I didn't used the notebook. With this new information in hand and new power saver settings, I left the notebook on a desk powered on and set to never turn off the screen. I powered it on at 11:00AM and it stayed on until 5:00AM the next day, that's 18 hours. So assuming you don't plan on using the notebook, perhaps you just want it as an art piece or paper weight for you desk, you aren't going to get the advertised battery life. I decided that even though I loved the beauty of the notebook I made the decision to return it and instead purchased a macbook air that on the first day of use lasted 11 hours and 57 minutes, and every day after that has out performed the Spectre's battery with the average being 10 hours of time on, even with the screen set to 90% brightness. So you just need to decide how you'll be using the notebook and if you need a long battery, if not I would definitely recommend this notebook, otherwise I'd pass. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by richard65 Pretty good device I have had this laptop now for a few months. I needed to replace another HP laptop which was stolen when I was traveling. I must say that I haven't found any problems so far; it has worked as advertised without any glitches. I like the convertible hinge and being able to use it more as a tablet. It is reasonably fast and the screen is good. I have watched many movies on Netflix; the sound is good, but I usually wear headphones. It connects to a TV with the HDMI connector. I was looking for a device with sufficient connectors, USB, etc and think this is a good compromise. The problem with lighter devices is that they have limited ability to connect things. I have been very happy with this laptop and hope it isn't stolen. May 14, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by OriTux Still Not Enough The specifications on this computer are in-line with what you would expect an ultrabook at this price to be. However, it lacks DDR4 RAM when it clearly is capable of handling it. HP cut a corner there. In addition, HP does not offer NVMe PCIe SSDs on this laptop. This is pretty much a flagship device and the lack of PCIe standard SSD is disappointing. The processor and RAM performance is pretty much identical to any other device that contains these specs. The keyboard and touchpad are both very good. There is a good amount of travel on the keyboards and the response is quick. Typing is quick and accurate. The extra wide touch pad makes using it a breeze and I honestly do not see why people think MacBook touchpads are significantly or even marginally better. The inclusion of a touchscreen means you have another option for input although the screen will move when you touch it. The hinge is not as tight as I would like it. There are plenty of ports and there is absolutely nothing to complain about. Heavy for tablet use so don't buy this if you think of procuring a 2-in-1. This is more of a laptop with touch. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by sumitmcc Amazing performance for the price I am definitely impresses by the device. I used HP envy 4 series ultrabook before and have tried some latest ultrabooks of DELL and Lenovo (XPS and Yoga Pro 3) recently and switching to this device is a choice I will never regret for sure. Pros: 1. Amazing looks! Catches attention everywhere you go. First they start comparing it to MacBook and then see it, use it and come out saying it is better than MacBook which is no exaggeration. 2. Touchscreen - yes, maybe not that essential in short term but try using Microsoft word on touchscreen and you will know why I love it (especially if you aren't a pro typist) 3. SSD - Yes, this fact cant be highlighted more. OFF to home screen in 2.5 seconds!!!! 4. Brilliant sound - Bang and Olufsen have totally nailed it with the sound quality. It is totally pleasant and also maintains the loudness - something that other brands don't focus much on 5. Battery - the fact that it gives 10 -11 hours straight is itself a compelling factor to buy it. And I am totally satisfied with that performance 6. Customer service - I have to give it to HP for this. The price of laptop reduced by 150$ in a week after I purchased. I contacted the customer care if I can get the refund for the difference. It was facilitated with no hassle! Cons - 1. Screen - the more you use the touchscreen, more it keeps accumulating the fingerprints. SO u need to wipe it frequently to make it look clean or buy a screenguard 2. headphone port - the headphone and mic port are integrated and the default play device is the laptop speakers. So if u are on skype or viber for calling then you have to change the default communications and playback device to headphone everytime which is kind of irritating 3. addictive - you just cant stop using the ultrabook, the more you use it, the more you feel the need to use it. If you are in university with friends then it is difficult to keept it away from friends ;-) All in all, I am totally happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who is planning to buy one. But if you are a gamer then this is not the right one for you.

May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by richard65 Pretty good device I have had this laptop now for a few months. I needed to replace another HP laptop which was stolen when I was traveling. I must say that I haven't found any problems so far; it has worked as advertised without any glitches. I like the convertible hinge and being able to use it more as a tablet. It is reasonably fast and the screen is good. I have watched many movies on Netflix; the sound is good, but I usually wear headphones. It connects to a TV with the HDMI connector. I was looking for a device with sufficient connectors, USB, etc and think this is a good compromise. The problem with lighter devices is that they have limited ability to connect things. I have been very happy with this laptop and hope it isn't stolen. May 14, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by OriTux Still Not Enough The specifications on this computer are in-line with what you would expect an ultrabook at this price to be. However, it lacks DDR4 RAM when it clearly is capable of handling it. HP cut a corner there. In addition, HP does not offer NVMe PCIe SSDs on this laptop. This is pretty much a flagship device and the lack of PCIe standard SSD is disappointing. The processor and RAM performance is pretty much identical to any other device that contains these specs. The keyboard and touchpad are both very good. There is a good amount of travel on the keyboards and the response is quick. Typing is quick and accurate. The extra wide touch pad makes using it a breeze and I honestly do not see why people think MacBook touchpads are significantly or even marginally better. The inclusion of a touchscreen means you have another option for input although the screen will move when you touch it. The hinge is not as tight as I would like it. There are plenty of ports and there is absolutely nothing to complain about. Heavy for tablet use so don't buy this if you think of procuring a 2-in-1. This is more of a laptop with touch. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by sumitmcc Amazing performance for the price I am definitely impresses by the device. I used HP envy 4 series ultrabook before and have tried some latest ultrabooks of DELL and Lenovo (XPS and Yoga Pro 3) recently and switching to this device is a choice I will never regret for sure. Pros: 1. Amazing looks! Catches attention everywhere you go. First they start comparing it to MacBook and then see it, use it and come out saying it is better than MacBook which is no exaggeration. 2. Touchscreen - yes, maybe not that essential in short term but try using Microsoft word on touchscreen and you will know why I love it (especially if you aren't a pro typist) 3. SSD - Yes, this fact cant be highlighted more. OFF to home screen in 2.5 seconds!!!! 4. Brilliant sound - Bang and Olufsen have totally nailed it with the sound quality. It is totally pleasant and also maintains the loudness - something that other brands don't focus much on 5. Battery - the fact that it gives 10 -11 hours straight is itself a compelling factor to buy it. And I am totally satisfied with that performance 6. Customer service - I have to give it to HP for this. The price of laptop reduced by 150$ in a week after I purchased. I contacted the customer care if I can get the refund for the difference. It was facilitated with no hassle! Cons - 1. Screen - the more you use the touchscreen, more it keeps accumulating the fingerprints. SO u need to wipe it frequently to make it look clean or buy a screenguard 2. headphone port - the headphone and mic port are integrated and the default play device is the laptop speakers. So if u are on skype or viber for calling then you have to change the default communications and playback device to headphone everytime which is kind of irritating 3. addictive - you just cant stop using the ultrabook, the more you use it, the more you feel the need to use it. If you are in university with friends then it is difficult to keept it away from friends ;-) All in all, I am totally happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who is planning to buy one. But if you are a gamer then this is not the right one for you.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by dakota95 The Best of the Best BUT Disappointing Battery I used this notebook for a little under a month and loved every minute it was powered on. The notebook has the best build quality I've ever felt, better than a macbook. It was always fast and responsive even under pressure. The 1080 screen is crisp and very bright. The speakers were underwhelming, not bad, just not a what I was expecting with the hype from a big name like B&O. Now then, the DISAPPOINTMENTS. The battery is terrible and under almost no circumstances will you get the advertised 13 hours of battery life. The first 2 days the battery last 3 and 4 hours respectively, and then I called tech support. Tech support updated the bios and told me the battery life I was receiving was normal. The next day the battery lasted 6 hours. But I don't think it had much to do with the bios update, I think I just used less demanding tasks. So in a quest to achieve a better battery I tweaked some settings, turning down the processor to only 70%, kept the brightness down below 40% and even turned off wifi for a large portion of the day. After all that the battery still only lasted about 6 for the remainder of my time with the notebook. Notice how I said in ALMOST no circumstances you will get the advertised battery, that is because the people I spoke to in tech support told me that I could achieve that time if I didn't used the notebook. With this new information in hand and new power saver settings, I left the notebook on a desk powered on and set to never turn off the screen. I powered it on at 11:00AM and it stayed on until 5:00AM the next day, that's 18 hours. So assuming you don't plan on using the notebook, perhaps you just want it as an art piece or paper weight for you desk, you aren't going to get the advertised battery life. I decided that even though I loved the beauty of the notebook I made the decision to return it and instead purchased a macbook air that on the first day of use lasted 11 hours and 57 minutes, and every day after that has out performed the Spectre's battery with the average being 10 hours of time on, even with the screen set to 90% brightness.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 4 out of 5 by dakota95 The Best of the Best BUT Disappointing Battery I used this notebook for a little under a month and loved every minute it was powered on. The notebook has the best build quality I've ever felt, better than a macbook. It was always fast and responsive even under pressure. The 1080 screen is crisp and very bright. The speakers were underwhelming, not bad, just not a what I was expecting with the hype from a big name like B&O. Now then, the DISAPPOINTMENTS. The battery is terrible and under almost no circumstances will you get the advertised 13 hours of battery life. The first 2 days the battery last 3 and 4 hours respectively, and then I called tech support. Tech support updated the bios and told me the battery life I was receiving was normal. The next day the battery lasted 6 hours. But I don't think it had much to do with the bios update, I think I just used less demanding tasks. So in a quest to achieve a better battery I tweaked some settings, turning down the processor to only 70%, kept the brightness down below 40% and even turned off wifi for a large portion of the day. After all that the battery still only lasted about 6 for the remainder of my time with the notebook. Notice how I said in ALMOST no circumstances you will get the advertised battery, that is because the people I spoke to in tech support told me that I could achieve that time if I didn't used the notebook. With this new information in hand and new power saver settings, I left the notebook on a desk powered on and set to never turn off the screen. I powered it on at 11:00AM and it stayed on until 5:00AM the next day, that's 18 hours. So assuming you don't plan on using the notebook, perhaps you just want it as an art piece or paper weight for you desk, you aren't going to get the advertised battery life. I decided that even though I loved the beauty of the notebook I made the decision to return it and instead purchased a macbook air that on the first day of use lasted 11 hours and 57 minutes, and every day after that has out performed the Spectre's battery with the average being 10 hours of time on, even with the screen set to 90% brightness. So you just need to decide how you'll be using the notebook and if you need a long battery, if not I would definitely recommend this notebook, otherwise I'd pass. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by richard65 Pretty good device I have had this laptop now for a few months. I needed to replace another HP laptop which was stolen when I was traveling. I must say that I haven't found any problems so far; it has worked as advertised without any glitches. I like the convertible hinge and being able to use it more as a tablet. It is reasonably fast and the screen is good. I have watched many movies on Netflix; the sound is good, but I usually wear headphones. It connects to a TV with the HDMI connector. I was looking for a device with sufficient connectors, USB, etc and think this is a good compromise. The problem with lighter devices is that they have limited ability to connect things. I have been very happy with this laptop and hope it isn't stolen. May 14, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by OriTux Still Not Enough The specifications on this computer are in-line with what you would expect an ultrabook at this price to be. However, it lacks DDR4 RAM when it clearly is capable of handling it. HP cut a corner there. In addition, HP does not offer NVMe PCIe SSDs on this laptop. This is pretty much a flagship device and the lack of PCIe standard SSD is disappointing. The processor and RAM performance is pretty much identical to any other device that contains these specs. The keyboard and touchpad are both very good. There is a good amount of travel on the keyboards and the response is quick. Typing is quick and accurate. The extra wide touch pad makes using it a breeze and I honestly do not see why people think MacBook touchpads are significantly or even marginally better. The inclusion of a touchscreen means you have another option for input although the screen will move when you touch it. The hinge is not as tight as I would like it. There are plenty of ports and there is absolutely nothing to complain about. Heavy for tablet use so don't buy this if you think of procuring a 2-in-1. This is more of a laptop with touch. May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by sumitmcc Amazing performance for the price I am definitely impresses by the device. I used HP envy 4 series ultrabook before and have tried some latest ultrabooks of DELL and Lenovo (XPS and Yoga Pro 3) recently and switching to this device is a choice I will never regret for sure. Pros: 1. Amazing looks! Catches attention everywhere you go. First they start comparing it to MacBook and then see it, use it and come out saying it is better than MacBook which is no exaggeration. 2. Touchscreen - yes, maybe not that essential in short term but try using Microsoft word on touchscreen and you will know why I love it (especially if you aren't a pro typist) 3. SSD - Yes, this fact cant be highlighted more. OFF to home screen in 2.5 seconds!!!! 4. Brilliant sound - Bang and Olufsen have totally nailed it with the sound quality. It is totally pleasant and also maintains the loudness - something that other brands don't focus much on 5. Battery - the fact that it gives 10 -11 hours straight is itself a compelling factor to buy it. And I am totally satisfied with that performance 6. Customer service - I have to give it to HP for this. The price of laptop reduced by 150$ in a week after I purchased. I contacted the customer care if I can get the refund for the difference. It was facilitated with no hassle! Cons - 1. Screen - the more you use the touchscreen, more it keeps accumulating the fingerprints. SO u need to wipe it frequently to make it look clean or buy a screenguard 2. headphone port - the headphone and mic port are integrated and the default play device is the laptop speakers. So if u are on skype or viber for calling then you have to change the default communications and playback device to headphone everytime which is kind of irritating 3. addictive - you just cant stop using the ultrabook, the more you use it, the more you feel the need to use it. If you are in university with friends then it is difficult to keept it away from friends ;-) All in all, I am totally happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who is planning to buy one. But if you are a gamer then this is not the right one for you.

May 14, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by sumitmcc Amazing performance for the price I am definitely impresses by the device. I used HP envy 4 series ultrabook before and have tried some latest ultrabooks of DELL and Lenovo (XPS and Yoga Pro 3) recently and switching to this device is a choice I will never regret for sure. Pros: 1. Amazing looks! Catches attention everywhere you go. First they start comparing it to MacBook and then see it, use it and come out saying it is better than MacBook which is no exaggeration. 2. Touchscreen - yes, maybe not that essential in short term but try using Microsoft word on touchscreen and you will know why I love it (especially if you aren't a pro typist) 3. SSD - Yes, this fact cant be highlighted more. OFF to home screen in 2.5 seconds!!!! 4. Brilliant sound - Bang and Olufsen have totally nailed it with the sound quality. It is totally pleasant and also maintains the loudness - something that other brands don't focus much on 5. Battery - the fact that it gives 10 -11 hours straight is itself a compelling factor to buy it. And I am totally satisfied with that performance 6. Customer service - I have to give it to HP for this. The price of laptop reduced by 150$ in a week after I purchased. I contacted the customer care if I can get the refund for the difference. It was facilitated with no hassle! Cons - 1. Screen - the more you use the touchscreen, more it keeps accumulating the fingerprints. SO u need to wipe it frequently to make it look clean or buy a screenguard 2. headphone port - the headphone and mic port are integrated and the default play device is the laptop speakers. So if u are on skype or viber for calling then you have to change the default communications and playback device to headphone everytime which is kind of irritating 3. addictive - you just cant stop using the ultrabook, the more you use it, the more you feel the need to use it. If you are in university with friends then it is difficult to keept it away from friends ;-) All in all, I am totally happy with this laptop and would recommend it to anyone who is planning to buy one. But if you are a gamer then this is not the right one for you. April 29, 2016 2016-10-16 bvseo-cps-pl-PRR
Rated 4 out of 5 by dakota95 The Best of the Best BUT Disappointing Battery I used this notebook for a little under a month and loved every minute it was powered on. The notebook has the best build quality I've ever felt, better than a macbook. It was always fast and responsive even under pressure. The 1080 screen is crisp and very bright. The speakers were underwhelming, not bad, just not a what I was expecting with the hype from a big name like B&O. Now then, the DISAPPOINTMENTS. The battery is terrible and under almost no circumstances will you get the advertised 13 hours of battery life. The first 2 days the battery last 3 and 4 hours respectively, and then I called tech support. Tech support updated the bios and told me the battery life I was receiving was normal. The next day the battery lasted 6 hours. But I don't think it had much to do with the bios update, I think I just used less demanding tasks. So in a quest to achieve a better battery I tweaked some settings, turning down the processor to only 70%, kept the brightness down below 40% and even turned off wifi for a large portion of the day. After all that the battery still only lasted about 6 for the remainder of my time with the notebook. Notice how I said in ALMOST no circumstances you will get the advertised battery, that is because the people I spoke to in tech support told me that I could achieve that time if I didn't used the notebook. With this new information in hand and new power saver settings, I left the notebook on a desk powered on and set to never turn off the screen. I powered it on at 11:00AM and it stayed on until 5:00AM the next day, that's 18 hours. So assuming you don't plan on using the notebook, perhaps you just want it as an art piece or paper weight for you desk, you aren't going to get the advertised battery life. I decided that even though I loved the beauty of the notebook I made the decision to return it and instead purchased a macbook air that on the first day of use lasted 11 hours and 57 minutes, and every day after that has out performed the Spectre's battery with the average being 10 hours of time on, even with the screen set to 90% brightness. So you just need to decide how you'll be using the notebook and if you need a long battery, if not I would definitely recommend this notebook, otherwise I'd pass.

Rated 5 out of 5 by richard65 Pretty good device I have had this laptop now for a few months. I needed to replace another HP laptop which was stolen when I was traveling. I must say that I haven't found any problems so far; it has worked as advertised without any glitches. I like the convertible hinge and being able to use it more as a tablet. It is reasonably fast and the screen is good. I have watched many movies on Netflix; the sound is good, but I usually wear headphones. It connects to a TV with the HDMI connector. I was looking for a device with sufficient connectors, USB, etc and think this is a good compromise. The problem with lighter devices is that they have limited ability to connect things. I have been very happy with this laptop and hope it isn't stolen. May 14, 2016

Rated 4 out of 5 by OriTux Still Not Enough The specifications on this computer are in-line with what you would expect an ultrabook at this price to be.
