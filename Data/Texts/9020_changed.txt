It looks super cool and it feels nice and solid. But that's it. I am confident I received a used laptop that Lenovo recovered. The worst thing about that is that it keeps a copy of the old windows and wastes my ssd !!!!(see picture). I hate that because I thought I purchased a laptop with 128gb of ssd . Also the fan on the left sounds like a helicopter and it makes me cringe that I spent soo much money. Also, the nvidia card wnats to update some drivers and it cant connect for some reason. I am extremely dissatisfied and I urge you all to consider my experience and be aware of what you will be purchasing. Date published: 2015-12-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by JJ86 from Awful Error Right Out of the Box I just got this delivered today. I was excited about a new laptop because I haven't had one in years, and I was looking forward to the portability. Right out of the box, it wouldn't boot up. I kept getting an error (in photo) and it would just shut down. Finally, after the 4th attempt, it booted. The trackpad continually fails. A stuck pixel keeps showing up. Adobe Creative Cloud wouldn't install after multiple attempts (this was the first install after Chrome). As I was going to reboot from the 4th attempt to install Adobe, it threw that error again. Now it's resetting the PC to factory. On another note, I went on chat with a rep and was informed that this came with one 8GB stick of RAM, but it has 2 sticks of 4. This is not a good impression at all. Right now I have a very expensive paperweight. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Jerrod from The best one on the market under 1500$ I dug really really deep for a laptop that had i7, 960m, sad, and 16 gigs of ram under 1500$ and 8bfound it! The 2.1 sound system is LOUD! I I love this laptop! The cooling system is pretty good and it has a reverse fan spin capabilities to keep everything clean which is a buggy for me because I do my work in a dusty basement lol It feels so nice to have a new video game and just click the "ultra grafics" button with any tweaks... I have no real complaints. The chasity is pretty strong. The only "negative" thing I guess I could say is that the ssd is a 126 and I wish it was a tad bit bigger. You barely have any room to work with. I do love the huge and 1 terreabyte hard drive.

I'm from India.This product isn't available in the Indian site yet. I want to purchase this on this US site.My relatives stay in US.They could buy it from here. SO the question is will i face any problems when i get it back to India? Asked by: TPRao I believe like most major manufacturers, Lenovo ships their computers with international power supplies designed to work with a variety of voltages and cycle rates (50, 60hz). All you should need is a plug adapter or a new IEC power cable for your region. Every other aspect of this computer should function fine.  As a note of interest. I have a laptop that is an Indian Spec machine. The supplied power brick worked fine here.  All i did to make it work in the USA was a new IEC cable for US outlets.  Answered by: AmericanMan Date published: 2015-12-31 I don't understand the price points for the Idealpad Y700 (17") models. The specs are identical for the CPU, GPU and hard drives. Look at 80Q00003US,80Q0001NUS and 80Q00010US. There is a $300 difference across the three. What's the difference? Asked by: Weevil The network card is different on some 8260 vs 3165 (look up the specs..way different) and the SS drives. Answered by: KPSRA Date published: 2015-12-01 max number ram and speed  for this model 80Q0001NUS ? Asked by: mohamed Maximum memory for all Y700 17" models is 16GB. The memory is DDR4-2133MHz.

It looks super cool and it feels nice and solid. But that's it. I am confident I received a used laptop that Lenovo recovered. The worst thing about that is that it keeps a copy of the old windows and wastes my ssd !!!!(see picture). I hate that because I thought I purchased a laptop with 128gb of ssd . Also the fan on the left sounds like a helicopter and it makes me cringe that I spent soo much money. Also, the nvidia card wnats to update some drivers and it cant connect for some reason. I am extremely dissatisfied and I urge you all to consider my experience and be aware of what you will be purchasing. Date published: 2015-12-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by JJ86 from Awful Error Right Out of the Box I just got this delivered today. I was excited about a new laptop because I haven't had one in years, and I was looking forward to the portability. Right out of the box, it wouldn't boot up. I kept getting an error (in photo) and it would just shut down. Finally, after the 4th attempt, it booted. The trackpad continually fails. A stuck pixel keeps showing up. Adobe Creative Cloud wouldn't install after multiple attempts (this was the first install after Chrome). As I was going to reboot from the 4th attempt to install Adobe, it threw that error again. Now it's resetting the PC to factory. On another note, I went on chat with a rep and was informed that this came with one 8GB stick of RAM, but it has 2 sticks of 4. This is not a good impression at all. Right now I have a very expensive paperweight. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Jerrod from The best one on the market under 1500$ I dug really really deep for a laptop that had i7, 960m, sad, and 16 gigs of ram under 1500$ and 8bfound it! The 2.1 sound system is LOUD! I I love this laptop! The cooling system is pretty good and it has a reverse fan spin capabilities to keep everything clean which is a buggy for me because I do my work in a dusty basement lol It feels so nice to have a new video game and just click the "ultra grafics" button with any tweaks... I have no real complaints. The chasity is pretty strong. The only "negative" thing I guess I could say is that the ssd is a 126 and I wish it was a tad bit bigger. You barely have any room to work with. I do love the huge and 1 terreabyte hard drive.

I'm from India.This product isn't available in the Indian site yet. I want to purchase this on this US site.My relatives stay in US.They could buy it from here. SO the question is will i face any problems when i get it back to India? Asked by: TPRao I believe like most major manufacturers, Lenovo ships their computers with international power supplies designed to work with a variety of voltages and cycle rates (50, 60hz). All you should need is a plug adapter or a new IEC power cable for your region. Every other aspect of this computer should function fine.  As a note of interest. I have a laptop that is an Indian Spec machine. The supplied power brick worked fine here.  All i did to make it work in the USA was a new IEC cable for US outlets.  Answered by: AmericanMan Date published: 2015-12-31 I don't understand the price points for the Idealpad Y700 (17") models. The specs are identical for the CPU, GPU and hard drives. Look at 80Q00003US,80Q0001NUS and 80Q00010US. There is a $300 difference across the three. What's the difference? Asked by: Weevil The network card is different on some 8260 vs 3165 (look up the specs..way different) and the SS drives. Answered by: KPSRA Date published: 2015-12-01 max number ram and speed  for this model 80Q0001NUS ? Asked by: mohamed Maximum memory for all Y700 17" models is 16GB. The memory is DDR4-2133MHz.

Rated 1 out of 5 by iwantedtobeleive from this review is for the 15 inch 4k model I was excited when I first bought this laptop. It looks super cool and it feels nice and solid. But that's it. I am confident I received a used laptop that Lenovo recovered. The worst thing about that is that it keeps a copy of the old windows and wastes my ssd !!!!(see picture). I hate that because I thought I purchased a laptop with 128gb of ssd . Also the fan on the left sounds like a helicopter and it makes me cringe that I spent soo much money. Also, the nvidia card wnats to update some drivers and it cant connect for some reason. I am extremely dissatisfied and I urge you all to consider my experience and be aware of what you will be purchasing. Date published: 2015-12-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by JJ86 from Awful Error Right Out of the Box I just got this delivered today. I was excited about a new laptop because I haven't had one in years, and I was looking forward to the portability. Right out of the box, it wouldn't boot up. I kept getting an error (in photo) and it would just shut down. Finally, after the 4th attempt, it booted. The trackpad continually fails. A stuck pixel keeps showing up. Adobe Creative Cloud wouldn't install after multiple attempts (this was the first install after Chrome). As I was going to reboot from the 4th attempt to install Adobe, it threw that error again. Now it's resetting the PC to factory. On another note, I went on chat with a rep and was informed that this came with one 8GB stick of RAM, but it has 2 sticks of 4. This is not a good impression at all. Right now I have a very expensive paperweight. Date published: 2016-07-22 Rated 5 out of 5 by Jerrod from The best one on the market under 1500$ I dug really really deep for a laptop that had i7, 960m, sad, and 16 gigs of ram under 1500$ and 8bfound it! The 2.1 sound system is LOUD! I I love this laptop! The cooling system is pretty good and it has a reverse fan spin capabilities to keep everything clean which is a buggy for me because I do my work in a dusty basement lol It feels so nice to have a new video game and just click the "ultra grafics" button with any tweaks... I have no real complaints. The chasity is pretty strong. The only "negative" thing I guess I could say is that the ssd is a 126 and I wish it was a tad bit bigger. You barely have any room to work with. I do love the huge and 1 terreabyte hard drive.

Rated 1 out of 5 by iwantedtobeleive from this review is for the 15 inch 4k model I was excited when I first bought this laptop. It looks super cool and it feels nice and solid. But that's it. I am confident I received a used laptop that Lenovo recovered. The worst thing about that is that it keeps a copy of the old windows and wastes my ssd !!!!(see picture). I hate that because I thought I purchased a laptop with 128gb of ssd . Also the fan on the left sounds like a helicopter and it makes me cringe that I spent soo much money. Also, the nvidia card wnats to update some drivers and it cant connect for some reason. I am extremely dissatisfied and I urge you all to consider my experience and be aware of what you will be purchasing. Date published: 2015-12-30 Rated 1 out of 5 by JJ86 from Awful Error Right Out of the Box I just got this delivered today. I was excited about a new laptop because I haven't had one in years, and I was looking forward to the portability. Right out of the box, it wouldn't boot up. I kept getting an error (in photo) and it would just shut down. Finally, after the 4th attempt, it booted. The trackpad continually fails. A stuck pixel keeps showing up. Adobe Creative Cloud wouldn't install after multiple attempts (this was the first install after Chrome). As I was going to reboot from the 4th attempt to install Adobe, it threw that error again. Now it's resetting the PC to factory. On another note, I went on chat with a rep and was informed that this came with one 8GB stick of RAM, but it has 2 sticks of 4. This is not a good impression at all. Right now I have a very expensive paperweight.

The 2.1 sound system is LOUD! I I love this laptop! The cooling system is pretty good and it has a reverse fan spin capabilities to keep everything clean which is a buggy for me because I do my work in a dusty basement lol It feels so nice to have a new video game and just click the "ultra grafics" button with any tweaks...

Hi. I'm from India.This product isn't available in the Indian site yet. I want to purchase this on this US site.My relatives stay in US.They could buy it from here. SO the question is will i face any problems when i get it back to India? Asked by: TPRao I believe like most major manufacturers, Lenovo ships their computers with international power supplies designed to work with a variety of voltages and cycle rates (50, 60hz). All you should need is a plug adapter or a new IEC power cable for your region. Every other aspect of this computer should function fine.  As a note of interest. I have a laptop that is an Indian Spec machine. The supplied power brick worked fine here.  All i did to make it work in the USA was a new IEC cable for US outlets.  Answered by: AmericanMan Date published: 2015-12-31 I don't understand the price points for the Idealpad Y700 (17") models. The specs are identical for the CPU, GPU and hard drives. Look at 80Q00003US,80Q0001NUS and 80Q00010US. There is a $300 difference across the three. What's the difference? Asked by: Weevil The network card is different on some 8260 vs 3165 (look up the specs..way different) and the SS drives. Answered by: KPSRA Date published: 2015-12-01 max number ram and speed  for this model 80Q0001NUS ? Asked by: mohamed Maximum memory for all Y700 17" models is 16GB. The memory is DDR4-2133MHz.
