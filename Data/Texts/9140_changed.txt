I got this laptop recently as a Christmas gift from my dad and it's been great. I am a computer science major and was in need of a laptop that is fast with a long lasting battery life. I use this to code on Eclipse and C++, watch movies and videos, play games, and everyday things. I've been using this laptop for about two and a half months and so far I haven't had any issues. If I come across any problems, I'll be sure to do a follow up on this review. NOTE: I bought my laptop with an Intel i7 Core Processor and with 8GB RAM Pros: Fast Long lasting battery life Good looking laptop Anti-glare screen Cons: No back-lit keyboard Date published: 2016-02-16 Rated 2 out of 5 by fredfredfred from Four failures, disappointed I've had this laptop for about a month and it has failed me four times. One day, after leaving it closed and asleep for a couple of hours I opened the top and could get no response from it ... black screen of death! The next two incidents were total system freeze ups in the middle of a Spider Solitaire game. Again I had to restart the machine by holding downt he start button. The final insult was yesterday when in the middle of a Sudoku game on the Internet "A critical process failed", and I had to restart, losing my game. I'm planning on taking this machine back to the dealer for help. Date published: 2016-02-27 Rated 3 out of 5 by Paultwo from Ok Laptop- But Expected More. Received the Laptop: Pros: Built Well Good Battery Life Cons: Extremely Slow Even Slower With Abobe Lightroom Conclusion: Expected more from Lenovo. Not very happy- Even after I maxed out the RAM!!! Lenovo shouldn't offer a non solid state drive if they know the computer will run soooo slowww.

I got this laptop recently as a Christmas gift from my dad and it's been great. I am a computer science major and was in need of a laptop that is fast with a long lasting battery life. I use this to code on Eclipse and C++, watch movies and videos, play games, and everyday things. I've been using this laptop for about two and a half months and so far I haven't had any issues. If I come across any problems, I'll be sure to do a follow up on this review. NOTE: I bought my laptop with an Intel i7 Core Processor and with 8GB RAM Pros: Fast Long lasting battery life Good looking laptop Anti-glare screen Cons: No back-lit keyboard Date published: 2016-02-16 Rated 2 out of 5 by fredfredfred from Four failures, disappointed I've had this laptop for about a month and it has failed me four times. One day, after leaving it closed and asleep for a couple of hours I opened the top and could get no response from it ... black screen of death! The next two incidents were total system freeze ups in the middle of a Spider Solitaire game. Again I had to restart the machine by holding downt he start button. The final insult was yesterday when in the middle of a Sudoku game on the Internet "A critical process failed", and I had to restart, losing my game. I'm planning on taking this machine back to the dealer for help. Date published: 2016-02-27 Rated 3 out of 5 by Paultwo from Ok Laptop- But Expected More. Received the Laptop: Pros: Built Well Good Battery Life Cons: Extremely Slow Even Slower With Abobe Lightroom Conclusion: Expected more from Lenovo. Not very happy- Even after I maxed out the RAM!!! Lenovo shouldn't offer a non solid state drive if they know the computer will run soooo slowww.

Asked by: a_vm Yes you are able to upgrade your storage drive Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-10-03 I was led to believe that we could have an option of a Linux OS on your models threw this link! The only Systems I can find here is just Microsoft! Asked by: Fuzzy T Hello, at this time, there is no option to have Linux OS installed as part of the configuration of the machine.

Rated 5 out of 5 by rdang626 from Excellent Laptop Highly recommend this to any student! I got this laptop recently as a Christmas gift from my dad and it's been great. I am a computer science major and was in need of a laptop that is fast with a long lasting battery life. I use this to code on Eclipse and C++, watch movies and videos, play games, and everyday things. I've been using this laptop for about two and a half months and so far I haven't had any issues. If I come across any problems, I'll be sure to do a follow up on this review. NOTE: I bought my laptop with an Intel i7 Core Processor and with 8GB RAM Pros: Fast Long lasting battery life Good looking laptop Anti-glare screen Cons: No back-lit keyboard Date published: 2016-02-16 Rated 2 out of 5 by fredfredfred from Four failures, disappointed I've had this laptop for about a month and it has failed me four times. One day, after leaving it closed and asleep for a couple of hours I opened the top and could get no response from it ... black screen of death! The next two incidents were total system freeze ups in the middle of a Spider Solitaire game. Again I had to restart the machine by holding downt he start button. The final insult was yesterday when in the middle of a Sudoku game on the Internet "A critical process failed", and I had to restart, losing my game. I'm planning on taking this machine back to the dealer for help. Date published: 2016-02-27 Rated 3 out of 5 by Paultwo from Ok Laptop- But Expected More. Received the Laptop: Pros: Built Well Good Battery Life Cons: Extremely Slow Even Slower With Abobe Lightroom Conclusion: Expected more from Lenovo. Not very happy- Even after I maxed out the RAM!!! Lenovo shouldn't offer a non solid state drive if they know the computer will run soooo slowww.
