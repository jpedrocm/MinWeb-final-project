By CourVO from Las Vegas, NV Comments about Toshiba 13.3" Chromebook Intel Celeron Laptop Computer: This is the right set of features that pleases on almost all counts. Speed, the look 'n' feel, technical specs, features, and size. I'd only fault the screen for not being a little sharper, but that's minor compared to the total package being the right combination of tools. No other Chromebook matches this suite.

By CourVO from Las Vegas, NV Comments about Toshiba 13.3" Chromebook Intel Celeron Laptop Computer: This is the right set of features that pleases on almost all counts. Speed, the look 'n' feel, technical specs, features, and size. I'd only fault the screen for not being a little sharper, but that's minor compared to the total package being the right combination of tools. No other Chromebook matches this suite.
