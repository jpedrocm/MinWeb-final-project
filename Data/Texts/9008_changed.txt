I bought this because I was impressed with the flex 3 and thought the flex 4 would be an improvement, but instead it is a huge disappointment. everything technical is amazing, I love the cpu, memory, Storage performance is great. but why did they have to change the fundamental keyboard when there was nothing wrong with the existing layout? Date published: 2016-07-30 Rated 4 out of 5 by ChrisSutton from Power for the price I bought this via Costco two weeks ago. Even after taxes, it was 2-3 hundred cheaper than the asking price of other comparable machines from different brands. This device is not feature rich for someone planning on using this as a mobile workstation, but overall does a great job. The biggest concern I have is storage space. I work with a lot of Virtual Machines, so having a secondary HD would be appreciated. Based on price, I figure I can upgrade to 512GB SSD and still be ahead. The Wireless adapter in the device is very fast, although I'm not sure what 'level' of AC it is, I would guess AC600/AC750, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was AC1200 based on speeds. The CPU is not the fastest, but being a 'U' processor instead of a 'HQ' means less heat, more battery time. And really, its still on par or slightly faster than an i5. Overall, well worth the money. Date published: 2016-07-21 Rated 2 out of 5 by schutnik from Shift Key - Really??? I agree with others on this one. While this laptop is great from a specs perspective, I cannot believe the location of the right shift key and it is killing my productivity with this laptop. It's so bad that I've started using my external keyboard with it and just carrying the external keyboard around with me. I must look like a complete idiot using an external keyboard with a laptop when sitting at a coffee shop, but at least I can be productive! Computers are supposed to be about productivity - one like this that kills productivity with such a simple change is really quite sad.

Just change the key functions? I love the laptop but I am considering buying a secondary keyboard because I am continuously making typing errors where I press the up arrow key instead of shift. Asked by: Bjohnson Sharpkeys or KeyTweak can change the registry to make the up arrow act like the shift key, but there doesn't seem to be any way to also make the shift key act like the up arrow at the same time. I'd like to have a usable right shift key (seriously, how did an unreachable shift key ever get approved? Does everyone at Lenovo hunt-and-peck?) more than I'd like to have an up arrow, but really, I may return this laptop since apparently I can't have both. Lenovo, you should really swap all 4 keys in the lower right corner left-to-right, so that the shift key is in a usable location for touch typists and the up and down arrows can be above and below each other, even if they are both to the right of the left and right arrows. Answered by: rocketguy Date published: 2016-08-11 The pictures here are not very good. It would be good to have a photo showing the laptop from all angles and sides. Where is the top down view? I need to know if the keyboard has the 10 key number pad on the right side. Not having that is a no go! Asked by: Jimschoice Someone in another forum mentioned the same problem about the location of the right Shift key. I have (had!) the same problem with a Logitech wireless keyboard I used on another machine. I fixed it by following their recommendation and downloading a free tool called Sharpkeys. You can remap any keys on they keyboard. You simply run the tool, click the key you want to change, click the key you want to substitute, and you're done (after a restart). I just swapped my right Shift and Up arrow keys, and it's perfect. After using this successfully, I decided to purchase this Lenovo because I trust the Lenovo brand more than any other (it was originally IBM, and much of the technology was actually purchased and rebranded by other manufacturers), and I liked all the specs. Answered by: lcouch Date published: 2016-07-28 Is the Intel 520 HD graphics card able to support 3440x1440p resolutions for 34" ultrawide displays? Asked by: Mike512 I have found that it will support whatever resolution that your monitor will support. I had no problems with my 30 inch HP wide screen (I like the HP screens) and also hdmi out to a 60 inch 4k Samsung television. The AMD APU is responsible for the resolutions and there are new drivers out for them. You may have to update your drivers first. I never had too, but someone else did.

I bought this because I was impressed with the flex 3 and thought the flex 4 would be an improvement, but instead it is a huge disappointment. everything technical is amazing, I love the cpu, memory, Storage performance is great. but why did they have to change the fundamental keyboard when there was nothing wrong with the existing layout? Date published: 2016-07-30 Rated 4 out of 5 by ChrisSutton from Power for the price I bought this via Costco two weeks ago. Even after taxes, it was 2-3 hundred cheaper than the asking price of other comparable machines from different brands. This device is not feature rich for someone planning on using this as a mobile workstation, but overall does a great job. The biggest concern I have is storage space. I work with a lot of Virtual Machines, so having a secondary HD would be appreciated. Based on price, I figure I can upgrade to 512GB SSD and still be ahead. The Wireless adapter in the device is very fast, although I'm not sure what 'level' of AC it is, I would guess AC600/AC750, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was AC1200 based on speeds. The CPU is not the fastest, but being a 'U' processor instead of a 'HQ' means less heat, more battery time. And really, its still on par or slightly faster than an i5. Overall, well worth the money. Date published: 2016-07-21 Rated 2 out of 5 by schutnik from Shift Key - Really??? I agree with others on this one. While this laptop is great from a specs perspective, I cannot believe the location of the right shift key and it is killing my productivity with this laptop. It's so bad that I've started using my external keyboard with it and just carrying the external keyboard around with me. I must look like a complete idiot using an external keyboard with a laptop when sitting at a coffee shop, but at least I can be productive! Computers are supposed to be about productivity - one like this that kills productivity with such a simple change is really quite sad.

Just change the key functions? I love the laptop but I am considering buying a secondary keyboard because I am continuously making typing errors where I press the up arrow key instead of shift. Asked by: Bjohnson Sharpkeys or KeyTweak can change the registry to make the up arrow act like the shift key, but there doesn't seem to be any way to also make the shift key act like the up arrow at the same time. I'd like to have a usable right shift key (seriously, how did an unreachable shift key ever get approved? Does everyone at Lenovo hunt-and-peck?) more than I'd like to have an up arrow, but really, I may return this laptop since apparently I can't have both. Lenovo, you should really swap all 4 keys in the lower right corner left-to-right, so that the shift key is in a usable location for touch typists and the up and down arrows can be above and below each other, even if they are both to the right of the left and right arrows. Answered by: rocketguy Date published: 2016-08-11 The pictures here are not very good. It would be good to have a photo showing the laptop from all angles and sides. Where is the top down view? I need to know if the keyboard has the 10 key number pad on the right side. Not having that is a no go! Asked by: Jimschoice Someone in another forum mentioned the same problem about the location of the right Shift key. I have (had!) the same problem with a Logitech wireless keyboard I used on another machine. I fixed it by following their recommendation and downloading a free tool called Sharpkeys. You can remap any keys on they keyboard. You simply run the tool, click the key you want to change, click the key you want to substitute, and you're done (after a restart). I just swapped my right Shift and Up arrow keys, and it's perfect. After using this successfully, I decided to purchase this Lenovo because I trust the Lenovo brand more than any other (it was originally IBM, and much of the technology was actually purchased and rebranded by other manufacturers), and I liked all the specs. Answered by: lcouch Date published: 2016-07-28 Is the Intel 520 HD graphics card able to support 3440x1440p resolutions for 34" ultrawide displays? Asked by: Mike512 I have found that it will support whatever resolution that your monitor will support. I had no problems with my 30 inch HP wide screen (I like the HP screens) and also hdmi out to a 60 inch 4k Samsung television. The AMD APU is responsible for the resolutions and there are new drivers out for them. You may have to update your drivers first. I never had too, but someone else did.

Rated 2 out of 5 by mattfosteraz from right shift key why? I bought this because I was impressed with the flex 3 and thought the flex 4 would be an improvement, but instead it is a huge disappointment. everything technical is amazing, I love the cpu, memory, Storage performance is great. but why did they have to change the fundamental keyboard when there was nothing wrong with the existing layout? Date published: 2016-07-30 Rated 4 out of 5 by ChrisSutton from Power for the price I bought this via Costco two weeks ago. Even after taxes, it was 2-3 hundred cheaper than the asking price of other comparable machines from different brands. This device is not feature rich for someone planning on using this as a mobile workstation, but overall does a great job. The biggest concern I have is storage space. I work with a lot of Virtual Machines, so having a secondary HD would be appreciated. Based on price, I figure I can upgrade to 512GB SSD and still be ahead. The Wireless adapter in the device is very fast, although I'm not sure what 'level' of AC it is, I would guess AC600/AC750, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was AC1200 based on speeds. The CPU is not the fastest, but being a 'U' processor instead of a 'HQ' means less heat, more battery time. And really, its still on par or slightly faster than an i5. Overall, well worth the money. Date published: 2016-07-21 Rated 2 out of 5 by schutnik from Shift Key - Really??? I agree with others on this one. While this laptop is great from a specs perspective, I cannot believe the location of the right shift key and it is killing my productivity with this laptop. It's so bad that I've started using my external keyboard with it and just carrying the external keyboard around with me. I must look like a complete idiot using an external keyboard with a laptop when sitting at a coffee shop, but at least I can be productive! Computers are supposed to be about productivity - one like this that kills productivity with such a simple change is really quite sad.

Is there any way to change the up arrow key to the shift key? Just change the key functions? I love the laptop but I am considering buying a secondary keyboard because I am continuously making typing errors where I press the up arrow key instead of shift. Asked by: Bjohnson Sharpkeys or KeyTweak can change the registry to make the up arrow act like the shift key, but there doesn't seem to be any way to also make the shift key act like the up arrow at the same time. I'd like to have a usable right shift key (seriously, how did an unreachable shift key ever get approved? Does everyone at Lenovo hunt-and-peck?) more than I'd like to have an up arrow, but really, I may return this laptop since apparently I can't have both. Lenovo, you should really swap all 4 keys in the lower right corner left-to-right, so that the shift key is in a usable location for touch typists and the up and down arrows can be above and below each other, even if they are both to the right of the left and right arrows. Answered by: rocketguy Date published: 2016-08-11 The pictures here are not very good. It would be good to have a photo showing the laptop from all angles and sides. Where is the top down view? I need to know if the keyboard has the 10 key number pad on the right side. Not having that is a no go! Asked by: Jimschoice Someone in another forum mentioned the same problem about the location of the right Shift key. I have (had!) the same problem with a Logitech wireless keyboard I used on another machine. I fixed it by following their recommendation and downloading a free tool called Sharpkeys. You can remap any keys on they keyboard. You simply run the tool, click the key you want to change, click the key you want to substitute, and you're done (after a restart). I just swapped my right Shift and Up arrow keys, and it's perfect. After using this successfully, I decided to purchase this Lenovo because I trust the Lenovo brand more than any other (it was originally IBM, and much of the technology was actually purchased and rebranded by other manufacturers), and I liked all the specs. Answered by: lcouch Date published: 2016-07-28 Is the Intel 520 HD graphics card able to support 3440x1440p resolutions for 34" ultrawide displays? Asked by: Mike512 I have found that it will support whatever resolution that your monitor will support. I had no problems with my 30 inch HP wide screen (I like the HP screens) and also hdmi out to a 60 inch 4k Samsung television. The AMD APU is responsible for the resolutions and there are new drivers out for them. You may have to update your drivers first. I never had too, but someone else did.

The AMD APU is responsible for the resolutions and there are new drivers out for them. You may have to update your drivers first. I never had too, but someone else did.
