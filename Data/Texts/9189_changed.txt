I purchased the Thinkpad Yoga 14 about a month ago and I am 100% pleased with the purchase. It is quite durable and a breeze to use. The keyboard is almost the same as a standard Thinkpad. The stylus is excellent quality and great sensitivity - A perfect work machine. Note that if you want to use a VGA monitor you will have to buy an dongle to support use (it does not come with adapter or VGA input) Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Patrick89 from Great laptop with all the right features I've had the 460 for about a month now. So far its been great for everything I need. I will say that I bought this at a 35% discount when Lenovo was trying to sell more models of the black version. I bought this laptop because it was a good middle ground for price/performance and features. In particular it was extremely hard to find a decent laptop with a digitizer stylus input. It has plenty of horsepower to multitask applications/stream etc (I have the i7 version and highly recommend upgrading the CPU from the i5 default.) Also recommend splurging for the 16GB RAM., I was also able to easily replace the hard drive with a larger SSD. It was easy enough to image the hard drive that came with the laptop to my 500GB SSD (hard drive swap took~30 min at most). I highly recommend imaging the drive on the machine instead of performing a cold reformat, as there are many drivers for sensors/digitizer etc that you want to make sure are installed correctly. I've read where others have had issues with screen rotation after reformatting due to driver problems. PROS Digitizer stylus input Good processing power Great screen size Very light CONS Laptop can act very sluggish when the charging cable is connected at very low battery (5-20%). Not sure what the issue is here. Sluggishness lasts for about 3-4 minutes. Battery life could be just a tad better. Its in that mid range for laptops. Lasts several hours, but definitely not all day without a charge. No USB C - This is a bit picky I know, but it would be a great feature to future-proof this model. Overall this is a great laptop. I would hesitate to purchase this at the list price only because I've seen this discounted to 35%. That lets you add all the features you really should take (upgrade display/processor/ram etc) without destroying your wallet. Date published: 2016-05-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by DramaticDelta from Great touch, keyboard, pen and overall performance This laptop is everything it promises to be, a tablet, a laptop, a machine of practical features. it has enough battery life to bring with you and use on the go. I have used it as a note sheet on a piano thanks to the tablet feature. I brought it with me on a trip and used it for practicing my drawing and painting skills. And I have also used it to write long emails and cv's. build quality is fantastic. only downside as far as i can tell is that the harddisk is bottle necking the whole system. meaning that whenever anything requiring disk allocation is running, the entire machine is grinding to a complete halt for 5-10 minutes at a time. this is usually only an issue on startup, but for some reason windows 10 loves scanning the computer over and over which in my case has caused quite a bit of frustration. overall however this machine has lived completely up to my expectation, and the costumer service leading up to my purchase was beyond sublime, so if you consider buying a lenovo machine but you're unsure which would be the best fit for you, I would highly recommend you get in touch with the customer service.

Asked by: sarai I have not seen any scratch marks in the 2 weeks of ownership Answered by: Jay2000 Date published: 2016-09-06 Is the Pen integrated and rechargeable in the Laptop itself like it's done with the ThinkPad Yoga 260? Asked by: Arrakis Yes, the pen is integrated and has a digitizer. The pen actually is charged by capacitance. This means that you literally just insert the pen into the built in slot and it is instantly recharged.  I've used this successfully on my 460 and it works extremely well. Answered by: Patrick89 Date published: 2016-05-17 I thought the Yoga 460 was supposed to have an option for a discrete GPU. Is this going to be made available later or was it modified to only ship with Intel HD Graphics 520?  Asked by: swirth It doesn't seem like that, HD 520 would be the only GPU available. If you'd like to have a discrete-GPU-loaded version of this ultrabook, go check P40 yoga of P series because it owns the same model with Yoga 460 but equiped with 1 Nvidia Quadro M500m professional GPU, which is suitable for works associated with media editing, designing or engineering. However, if you need a discrete GPU for gaming use, the two GPUs just work even the same so picking this one would be better considering the price. Hope that helps.

I purchased the Thinkpad Yoga 14 about a month ago and I am 100% pleased with the purchase. It is quite durable and a breeze to use. The keyboard is almost the same as a standard Thinkpad. The stylus is excellent quality and great sensitivity - A perfect work machine. Note that if you want to use a VGA monitor you will have to buy an dongle to support use (it does not come with adapter or VGA input) Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Patrick89 from Great laptop with all the right features I've had the 460 for about a month now. So far its been great for everything I need. I will say that I bought this at a 35% discount when Lenovo was trying to sell more models of the black version. I bought this laptop because it was a good middle ground for price/performance and features. In particular it was extremely hard to find a decent laptop with a digitizer stylus input. It has plenty of horsepower to multitask applications/stream etc (I have the i7 version and highly recommend upgrading the CPU from the i5 default.) Also recommend splurging for the 16GB RAM., I was also able to easily replace the hard drive with a larger SSD. It was easy enough to image the hard drive that came with the laptop to my 500GB SSD (hard drive swap took~30 min at most). I highly recommend imaging the drive on the machine instead of performing a cold reformat, as there are many drivers for sensors/digitizer etc that you want to make sure are installed correctly. I've read where others have had issues with screen rotation after reformatting due to driver problems. PROS Digitizer stylus input Good processing power Great screen size Very light CONS Laptop can act very sluggish when the charging cable is connected at very low battery (5-20%). Not sure what the issue is here. Sluggishness lasts for about 3-4 minutes. Battery life could be just a tad better. Its in that mid range for laptops. Lasts several hours, but definitely not all day without a charge. No USB C - This is a bit picky I know, but it would be a great feature to future-proof this model. Overall this is a great laptop. I would hesitate to purchase this at the list price only because I've seen this discounted to 35%. That lets you add all the features you really should take (upgrade display/processor/ram etc) without destroying your wallet. Date published: 2016-05-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by DramaticDelta from Great touch, keyboard, pen and overall performance This laptop is everything it promises to be, a tablet, a laptop, a machine of practical features. it has enough battery life to bring with you and use on the go. I have used it as a note sheet on a piano thanks to the tablet feature. I brought it with me on a trip and used it for practicing my drawing and painting skills. And I have also used it to write long emails and cv's. build quality is fantastic. only downside as far as i can tell is that the harddisk is bottle necking the whole system. meaning that whenever anything requiring disk allocation is running, the entire machine is grinding to a complete halt for 5-10 minutes at a time. this is usually only an issue on startup, but for some reason windows 10 loves scanning the computer over and over which in my case has caused quite a bit of frustration. overall however this machine has lived completely up to my expectation, and the costumer service leading up to my purchase was beyond sublime, so if you consider buying a lenovo machine but you're unsure which would be the best fit for you, I would highly recommend you get in touch with the customer service.

Asked by: sarai I have not seen any scratch marks in the 2 weeks of ownership Answered by: Jay2000 Date published: 2016-09-06 Is the Pen integrated and rechargeable in the Laptop itself like it's done with the ThinkPad Yoga 260? Asked by: Arrakis Yes, the pen is integrated and has a digitizer. The pen actually is charged by capacitance. This means that you literally just insert the pen into the built in slot and it is instantly recharged.  I've used this successfully on my 460 and it works extremely well. Answered by: Patrick89 Date published: 2016-05-17 I thought the Yoga 460 was supposed to have an option for a discrete GPU. Is this going to be made available later or was it modified to only ship with Intel HD Graphics 520?  Asked by: swirth It doesn't seem like that, HD 520 would be the only GPU available. If you'd like to have a discrete-GPU-loaded version of this ultrabook, go check P40 yoga of P series because it owns the same model with Yoga 460 but equiped with 1 Nvidia Quadro M500m professional GPU, which is suitable for works associated with media editing, designing or engineering. However, if you need a discrete GPU for gaming use, the two GPUs just work even the same so picking this one would be better considering the price. Hope that helps.

Rated 5 out of 5 by ngmart from Thinkpad Yoga 14 - It's the same thing! I purchased the Thinkpad Yoga 14 about a month ago and I am 100% pleased with the purchase. It is quite durable and a breeze to use. The keyboard is almost the same as a standard Thinkpad. The stylus is excellent quality and great sensitivity - A perfect work machine. Note that if you want to use a VGA monitor you will have to buy an dongle to support use (it does not come with adapter or VGA input) Date published: 2016-05-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by Patrick89 from Great laptop with all the right features I've had the 460 for about a month now. So far its been great for everything I need. I will say that I bought this at a 35% discount when Lenovo was trying to sell more models of the black version. I bought this laptop because it was a good middle ground for price/performance and features. In particular it was extremely hard to find a decent laptop with a digitizer stylus input. It has plenty of horsepower to multitask applications/stream etc (I have the i7 version and highly recommend upgrading the CPU from the i5 default.) Also recommend splurging for the 16GB RAM., I was also able to easily replace the hard drive with a larger SSD. It was easy enough to image the hard drive that came with the laptop to my 500GB SSD (hard drive swap took~30 min at most). I highly recommend imaging the drive on the machine instead of performing a cold reformat, as there are many drivers for sensors/digitizer etc that you want to make sure are installed correctly. I've read where others have had issues with screen rotation after reformatting due to driver problems. PROS Digitizer stylus input Good processing power Great screen size Very light CONS Laptop can act very sluggish when the charging cable is connected at very low battery (5-20%). Not sure what the issue is here. Sluggishness lasts for about 3-4 minutes. Battery life could be just a tad better. Its in that mid range for laptops. Lasts several hours, but definitely not all day without a charge. No USB C - This is a bit picky I know, but it would be a great feature to future-proof this model. Overall this is a great laptop. I would hesitate to purchase this at the list price only because I've seen this discounted to 35%. That lets you add all the features you really should take (upgrade display/processor/ram etc) without destroying your wallet. Date published: 2016-05-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by DramaticDelta from Great touch, keyboard, pen and overall performance This laptop is everything it promises to be, a tablet, a laptop, a machine of practical features. it has enough battery life to bring with you and use on the go. I have used it as a note sheet on a piano thanks to the tablet feature. I brought it with me on a trip and used it for practicing my drawing and painting skills. And I have also used it to write long emails and cv's. build quality is fantastic. only downside as far as i can tell is that the harddisk is bottle necking the whole system. meaning that whenever anything requiring disk allocation is running, the entire machine is grinding to a complete halt for 5-10 minutes at a time. this is usually only an issue on startup, but for some reason windows 10 loves scanning the computer over and over which in my case has caused quite a bit of frustration. overall however this machine has lived completely up to my expectation, and the costumer service leading up to my purchase was beyond sublime, so if you consider buying a lenovo machine but you're unsure which would be the best fit for you, I would highly recommend you get in touch with the customer service.

Date published: 2016-05-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by DramaticDelta from Great touch, keyboard, pen and overall performance This laptop is everything it promises to be, a tablet, a laptop, a machine of practical features. it has enough battery life to bring with you and use on the go. I have used it as a note sheet on a piano thanks to the tablet feature. I brought it with me on a trip and used it for practicing my drawing and painting skills. And I have also used it to write long emails and cv's. build quality is fantastic. only downside as far as i can tell is that the harddisk is bottle necking the whole system. meaning that whenever anything requiring disk allocation is running, the entire machine is grinding to a complete halt for 5-10 minutes at a time. this is usually only an issue on startup, but for some reason windows 10 loves scanning the computer over and over which in my case has caused quite a bit of frustration. overall however this machine has lived completely up to my expectation, and the costumer service leading up to my purchase was beyond sublime, so if you consider buying a lenovo machine but you're unsure which would be the best fit for you, I would highly recommend you get in touch with the customer service.

Rated 5 out of 5 by ngmart from Thinkpad Yoga 14 - It's the same thing! I purchased the Thinkpad Yoga 14 about a month ago and I am 100% pleased with the purchase. It is quite durable and a breeze to use. The keyboard is almost the same as a standard Thinkpad. The stylus is excellent quality and great sensitivity - A perfect work machine. Note that if you want to use a VGA monitor you will have to buy an dongle to support use (it does not come with adapter or VGA input) Date published: 2016-05-23

Rated 5 out of 5 by Patrick89 from Great laptop with all the right features I've had the 460 for about a month now. So far its been great for everything I need. I will say that I bought this at a 35% discount when Lenovo was trying to sell more models of the black version. I bought this laptop because it was a good middle ground for price/performance and features. In particular it was extremely hard to find a decent laptop with a digitizer stylus input. It has plenty of horsepower to multitask applications/stream etc (I have the i7 version and highly recommend upgrading the CPU from the i5 default.) Also recommend splurging for the 16GB RAM., I was also able to easily replace the hard drive with a larger SSD. It was easy enough to image the hard drive that came with the laptop to my 500GB SSD (hard drive swap took~30 min at most).

Does digital pen make noticeable scratch marks on anti-glare LCD panel? Asked by: sarai I have not seen any scratch marks in the 2 weeks of ownership Answered by: Jay2000 Date published: 2016-09-06 Is the Pen integrated and rechargeable in the Laptop itself like it's done with the ThinkPad Yoga 260? Asked by: Arrakis Yes, the pen is integrated and has a digitizer. The pen actually is charged by capacitance. This means that you literally just insert the pen into the built in slot and it is instantly recharged.  I've used this successfully on my 460 and it works extremely well. Answered by: Patrick89 Date published: 2016-05-17 I thought the Yoga 460 was supposed to have an option for a discrete GPU. Is this going to be made available later or was it modified to only ship with Intel HD Graphics 520?  Asked by: swirth It doesn't seem like that, HD 520 would be the only GPU available. If you'd like to have a discrete-GPU-loaded version of this ultrabook, go check P40 yoga of P series because it owns the same model with Yoga 460 but equiped with 1 Nvidia Quadro M500m professional GPU, which is suitable for works associated with media editing, designing or engineering. However, if you need a discrete GPU for gaming use, the two GPUs just work even the same so picking this one would be better considering the price. Hope that helps.
