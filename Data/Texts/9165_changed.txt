I passed on another brand when they came out with white versions a few years ago and then the white laptop just disappeared. Maybe it's just me, but I find working on a black or black and silver machine depressing. The 100S is beautifully designed, eerily quiet, boots up in a flash - especially if you bypass the password. I use it for writing and I find the 11' screen perfect for this, since it mirrors an actual page size - like typing on a typewriter. The best part is the positioning of the keyboard. So many laptops at ten times the price have keyboards shoved way to the back to make room for enormous touch pads and I find the reach very uncomfortable if I'm using it primarily for word processing. I've read some complaints about the touch pad not having a scroll function, but I'm actually happy without that since I have no use for it.. I don't watch movies or listen to music on it, but tested it out just to see how it sounds and it seems pretty good to me. Date published: 2015-11-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by brennan from worst laptop ever So I bought this about a month ago and it was good for about 1 day and then it wouldn't let me type it wouldn't let me load any apps it wouldn't let me transvers my pictures from my phones. And the speed is awful it cant play videos it freezes all to heck and it will shut down and crash if you try to even get onto any app or and while typing this it is freezing up, and for 400 dollars it is the worst first laptop investment I have ever had. because it wont let me watch my videos that I have put into the laptop I just cant use this for my photography business it is very unreliable laptop if I can hopefully get my money back I can get something better.

I passed on another brand when they came out with white versions a few years ago and then the white laptop just disappeared. Maybe it's just me, but I find working on a black or black and silver machine depressing. The 100S is beautifully designed, eerily quiet, boots up in a flash - especially if you bypass the password. I use it for writing and I find the 11' screen perfect for this, since it mirrors an actual page size - like typing on a typewriter. The best part is the positioning of the keyboard. So many laptops at ten times the price have keyboards shoved way to the back to make room for enormous touch pads and I find the reach very uncomfortable if I'm using it primarily for word processing. I've read some complaints about the touch pad not having a scroll function, but I'm actually happy without that since I have no use for it.. I don't watch movies or listen to music on it, but tested it out just to see how it sounds and it seems pretty good to me. Date published: 2015-11-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by brennan from worst laptop ever So I bought this about a month ago and it was good for about 1 day and then it wouldn't let me type it wouldn't let me load any apps it wouldn't let me transvers my pictures from my phones. And the speed is awful it cant play videos it freezes all to heck and it will shut down and crash if you try to even get onto any app or and while typing this it is freezing up, and for 400 dollars it is the worst first laptop investment I have ever had. because it wont let me watch my videos that I have put into the laptop I just cant use this for my photography business it is very unreliable laptop if I can hopefully get my money back I can get something better.

Asked by: minecraftmom This should run Minecraft quite well. Here is a vid of the laptop playing Minecraft: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0mKEQAnqSA FPS means Frames Per Second, or how fast the computer is able to process the game. More FPS is better. This laptop runs Minecraft around 40-60fps, which is definitely playable.

Rated 5 out of 5 by lobo from I like this laptop I like the fact that I can use it as both a laptop or a pad when folding the screen all the over in the I guess you would call it the pad place, I like also the speed in which it brings things up, for someone like me it is also important that it is easy to use in that I did not grow up with computers and I am still learning how and what to get, i like the weight as well as because of health issues I can no longer carry a heavy laptop around, as far as I feel about it right now this will not be the last Lenovo product I get, I have been impressed with it, and how simple it has been to learn to work it, in both the laptop mode and as a pad, Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 5 out of 5 by DB Brooklyn from Attractive and Functional Finally, a white laptop! I passed on another brand when they came out with white versions a few years ago and then the white laptop just disappeared. Maybe it's just me, but I find working on a black or black and silver machine depressing. The 100S is beautifully designed, eerily quiet, boots up in a flash - especially if you bypass the password. I use it for writing and I find the 11' screen perfect for this, since it mirrors an actual page size - like typing on a typewriter. The best part is the positioning of the keyboard. So many laptops at ten times the price have keyboards shoved way to the back to make room for enormous touch pads and I find the reach very uncomfortable if I'm using it primarily for word processing. I've read some complaints about the touch pad not having a scroll function, but I'm actually happy without that since I have no use for it.. I don't watch movies or listen to music on it, but tested it out just to see how it sounds and it seems pretty good to me. Date published: 2015-11-24 Rated 1 out of 5 by brennan from worst laptop ever So I bought this about a month ago and it was good for about 1 day and then it wouldn't let me type it wouldn't let me load any apps it wouldn't let me transvers my pictures from my phones. And the speed is awful it cant play videos it freezes all to heck and it will shut down and crash if you try to even get onto any app or and while typing this it is freezing up, and for 400 dollars it is the worst first laptop investment I have ever had. because it wont let me watch my videos that I have put into the laptop I just cant use this for my photography business it is very unreliable laptop if I can hopefully get my money back I can get something better.

I have an 8 year old that is obsessed with MineCraft.  Will this computer run smoothly for this purpose? Asked by: minecraftmom This should run Minecraft quite well. Here is a vid of the laptop playing Minecraft: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0mKEQAnqSA FPS means Frames Per Second, or how fast the computer is able to process the game. More FPS is better. This laptop runs Minecraft around 40-60fps, which is definitely playable.
