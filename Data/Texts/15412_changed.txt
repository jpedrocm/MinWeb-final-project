The 5th generation Intel® Core™i5 processor features Intel Turbo Boost 2 which increases the speed of the processor to match the task at hand. Turbo Boost reduces power consumption when you're browsing the web and ramps it up when rendering images or editing large audio clips, so you always get the best mix of power and efficiency. Intel® Iris® graphics and Retina Display Intel® Iris® graphics boost the MacBook's visual performance for greatly improved video and photo quality. Apple's Retina display has a better-than-HD resolution of 2560 x 1600. When combined with Iris® graphics, you have the clarity, detail and performance you need to create professional documents.   Force Touch trackpad The MacBook Pro 2015 is the first MacBook to feature Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clips simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

The 5th generation Intel® Core™i5 processor features Intel Turbo Boost 2 which increases the speed of the processor to match the task at hand. Turbo Boost reduces power consumption when you're browsing the web and ramps it up when rendering images or editing large audio clips, so you always get the best mix of power and efficiency. Intel® Iris® graphics and Retina Display Intel® Iris® graphics boost the MacBook's visual performance for greatly improved video and photo quality. Apple's Retina display has a better-than-HD resolution of 2560 x 1600. When combined with Iris® graphics, you have the clarity, detail and performance you need to create professional documents.   Force Touch trackpad The MacBook Pro 2015 is the first MacBook to feature Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clips simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

The 5th generation Intel® Core™i5 processor features Intel Turbo Boost 2 which increases the speed of the processor to match the task at hand. Turbo Boost reduces power consumption when you're browsing the web and ramps it up when rendering images or editing large audio clips, so you always get the best mix of power and efficiency. Intel® Iris® graphics and Retina Display Intel® Iris® graphics boost the MacBook's visual performance for greatly improved video and photo quality. Apple's Retina display has a better-than-HD resolution of 2560 x 1600. When combined with Iris® graphics, you have the clarity, detail and performance you need to create professional documents.   Force Touch trackpad The MacBook Pro 2015 is the first MacBook to feature Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clips simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Specification Bundles 1 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 10 Product information Highlights - Powerful 5th generation Intel® Core® processing delivers fast and reliable computing - Beautifully detailed Retina display is bright, clear hugely detailed - The New Force Touch trackpad makes navigation faster and more intuitive than ever - OS X Yosemite is easy to use and makes working, creating and researching easy The latest Intel® t echnology From editing photos and graphics design to writing essays and reports, the MacBook Pro has the performance you need to get things done. The 5th generation Intel® Core™i5 processor features Intel Turbo Boost 2 which increases the speed of the processor to match the task at hand. Turbo Boost reduces power consumption when you're browsing the web and ramps it up when rendering images or editing large audio clips, so you always get the best mix of power and efficiency. Intel® Iris® graphics and Retina Display Intel® Iris® graphics boost the MacBook's visual performance for greatly improved video and photo quality. Apple's Retina display has a better-than-HD resolution of 2560 x 1600. When combined with Iris® graphics, you have the clarity, detail and performance you need to create professional documents.   Force Touch trackpad The MacBook Pro 2015 is the first MacBook to feature Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clips simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Product information Highlights - Powerful 5th generation Intel® Core® processing delivers fast and reliable computing - Beautifully detailed Retina display is bright, clear hugely detailed - The New Force Touch trackpad makes navigation faster and more intuitive than ever - OS X Yosemite is easy to use and makes working, creating and researching easy The latest Intel® t echnology From editing photos and graphics design to writing essays and reports, the MacBook Pro has the performance you need to get things done. The 5th generation Intel® Core™i5 processor features Intel Turbo Boost 2 which increases the speed of the processor to match the task at hand. Turbo Boost reduces power consumption when you're browsing the web and ramps it up when rendering images or editing large audio clips, so you always get the best mix of power and efficiency. Intel® Iris® graphics and Retina Display Intel® Iris® graphics boost the MacBook's visual performance for greatly improved video and photo quality. Apple's Retina display has a better-than-HD resolution of 2560 x 1600. When combined with Iris® graphics, you have the clarity, detail and performance you need to create professional documents.   Force Touch trackpad The MacBook Pro 2015 is the first MacBook to feature Apple's new Force Touch trackpad. Rather than a normal ‘click', it vibrates to let you know a click has been registered. You click anywhere on the pad, so you aren't confined to using buttons at the bottom like most trackpads. You get different results depending on how hard you press, so you can activate double and left clips simply by pressing slightly harder. All the normal Apple gestures are still present, so you can move between software, pages and applications with simple finger movements. OS X Yosemite The Mac Pro runs on Apple's intuitive Yosemite operating system. Simple to navigate yet capable of professional-level computing, it provides an expressive platform for you to work and play the way you want. iCloud is integrated into every aspect of Yosemite, so you can share documents between all your Apple products and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic backup and Time Machine compatibility.  There are over 200 new features and updates compared to the previous generation OS, including improved software and device integration, new apps and enhancements for users with multiple displays. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
