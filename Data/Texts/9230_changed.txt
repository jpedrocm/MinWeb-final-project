So far it has been great. Didn't have any issues. I got the FHD version with Xeon processor. Initially I was little reluctant to buy because of the FHD screen reviews I saw online. The screen is a little less bright but you wont notice that unless you go outside in bright sunlight. But otherwise display is pretty great for my purposes, which is mostly coding and surfing. I got used to off center keyboard although would have preferred a keyboard without numpad. Laptop is very silent. Speakers are not that great but I don't really care about in-laptop speakers. Overall this laptop really worked for me. Date published: 2016-06-28 Rated 4 out of 5 by DR7990 from Lenovo Thinkpad delivers server capable P50 laptop I never write reviews, but have to for this product, the quality feel and performance of this laptop is unbeatable. Added 64 GB of memory and this thing truly delivers server like capabilities. I am running VMWare virtualization, VMs within ESXi6 nested on top of Workstation 12, with no issues. Some technical feedback for consumers out there considering the P50... The P50 has an extra slot to add an additional 2.5 inch HDD or SSD, or in the same slot space, you can add two M.2 flash drives, either SATA6G or NVMe which delivers 24gb/s transfer rates. Now here is the big disappointment, be aware the Lenovo P50 requires additional accessories, a tray for either the 2.5 inch drive or the flash drives, and they do not have this tray in stock, there is a 90 day or better wait period. Date published: 2016-02-05 Rated 5 out of 5 by kkctechNick from Finally a good display and slim design I just got this after waiting a month. They keyboard is excellent. It is so much better to have the battery in the front and not sticking off the back. The (4k) screen covers 100% srgb, 100% ntsc and 100% adobe rgb. I was worried it would not as most thinkpads of late have been bad for photo/video editing and this is great. It has plenty of storage options and horse power for photoshop and Lightroom. I got the model with 16gb ram, Xeon 1505, 512 nvme ssd. It is also great to have all the ports in the back vs the sides.

Is there any known issues of working with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on P50? And is it possible to have Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed when I get P50? Thanks in advance! Asked by: yoon I am running Ubuntu 16.04 in my P50. I use a dual boot configuration, using one SSD with Windows 10, and one SSD with Linux. The only issue I currently have with Ubuntu is the size of the controls in the 4K display. Also, using the built-in 4K display together with a lower resolution external display can be problematic. Running Linux in Virtual Box should be no problem. Answered by: subquantic Date published: 2016-08-16 Would like to buy P50 but have a questions. For the second SSD can I purchase Sata SSD and place it in laptop. I am also thinking of going with just one hard drive for now and later adding the SSDs can I use the SSD which I already have. Asked by: Amar From what I remember from my buying experience, you can select two drives, both of which can be whatever you want. They only trouble with that is that it becomes a custom build and the shipping might take a bit longer. I will say, however, that Lenovo delivered on time and as promised. They did a great job and I'm very happy with my machine. Answered by: danevans0724 Date published: 2016-09-08 Best docking system for ThinkPad P50 Asked by: Dan H Thinkpad Workstation Dock. We have about 10 of them around the office for our P50 laptops. Tried one of the USB type C little "universal" docking boxes - I image those will get better - but the one we tried was not stable with the monitors.

So far it has been great. Didn't have any issues. I got the FHD version with Xeon processor. Initially I was little reluctant to buy because of the FHD screen reviews I saw online. The screen is a little less bright but you wont notice that unless you go outside in bright sunlight. But otherwise display is pretty great for my purposes, which is mostly coding and surfing. I got used to off center keyboard although would have preferred a keyboard without numpad. Laptop is very silent. Speakers are not that great but I don't really care about in-laptop speakers. Overall this laptop really worked for me. Date published: 2016-06-28 Rated 4 out of 5 by DR7990 from Lenovo Thinkpad delivers server capable P50 laptop I never write reviews, but have to for this product, the quality feel and performance of this laptop is unbeatable. Added 64 GB of memory and this thing truly delivers server like capabilities. I am running VMWare virtualization, VMs within ESXi6 nested on top of Workstation 12, with no issues. Some technical feedback for consumers out there considering the P50... The P50 has an extra slot to add an additional 2.5 inch HDD or SSD, or in the same slot space, you can add two M.2 flash drives, either SATA6G or NVMe which delivers 24gb/s transfer rates. Now here is the big disappointment, be aware the Lenovo P50 requires additional accessories, a tray for either the 2.5 inch drive or the flash drives, and they do not have this tray in stock, there is a 90 day or better wait period. Date published: 2016-02-05 Rated 5 out of 5 by kkctechNick from Finally a good display and slim design I just got this after waiting a month. They keyboard is excellent. It is so much better to have the battery in the front and not sticking off the back. The (4k) screen covers 100% srgb, 100% ntsc and 100% adobe rgb. I was worried it would not as most thinkpads of late have been bad for photo/video editing and this is great. It has plenty of storage options and horse power for photoshop and Lightroom. I got the model with 16gb ram, Xeon 1505, 512 nvme ssd. It is also great to have all the ports in the back vs the sides.

Is there any known issues of working with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on P50? And is it possible to have Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed when I get P50? Thanks in advance! Asked by: yoon I am running Ubuntu 16.04 in my P50. I use a dual boot configuration, using one SSD with Windows 10, and one SSD with Linux. The only issue I currently have with Ubuntu is the size of the controls in the 4K display. Also, using the built-in 4K display together with a lower resolution external display can be problematic. Running Linux in Virtual Box should be no problem. Answered by: subquantic Date published: 2016-08-16 Would like to buy P50 but have a questions. For the second SSD can I purchase Sata SSD and place it in laptop. I am also thinking of going with just one hard drive for now and later adding the SSDs can I use the SSD which I already have. Asked by: Amar From what I remember from my buying experience, you can select two drives, both of which can be whatever you want. They only trouble with that is that it becomes a custom build and the shipping might take a bit longer. I will say, however, that Lenovo delivered on time and as promised. They did a great job and I'm very happy with my machine. Answered by: danevans0724 Date published: 2016-09-08 Best docking system for ThinkPad P50 Asked by: Dan H Thinkpad Workstation Dock. We have about 10 of them around the office for our P50 laptops. Tried one of the USB type C little "universal" docking boxes - I image those will get better - but the one we tried was not stable with the monitors.

Rated 5 out of 5 by ronin from great laptop I bought this laptop almost over a moth back. So far it has been great. Didn't have any issues. I got the FHD version with Xeon processor. Initially I was little reluctant to buy because of the FHD screen reviews I saw online. The screen is a little less bright but you wont notice that unless you go outside in bright sunlight.

Some technical feedback for consumers out there considering the P50... The P50 has an extra slot to add an additional 2.5 inch HDD or SSD, or in the same slot space, you can add two M.2 flash drives, either SATA6G or NVMe which delivers 24gb/s transfer rates. Now here is the big disappointment, be aware the Lenovo P50 requires additional accessories, a tray for either the 2.5 inch drive or the flash drives, and they do not have this tray in stock, there is a 90 day or better wait period.

Rated 5 out of 5 by ronin from great laptop I bought this laptop almost over a moth back. So far it has been great. Didn't have any issues. I got the FHD version with Xeon processor. Initially I was little reluctant to buy because of the FHD screen reviews I saw online. The screen is a little less bright but you wont notice that unless you go outside in bright sunlight. But otherwise display is pretty great for my purposes, which is mostly coding and surfing. I got used to off center keyboard although would have preferred a keyboard without numpad.

I am thinking of purchasing P50 but have quick questions. Is there any known issues of working with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on P50? And is it possible to have Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed when I get P50? Thanks in advance! Asked by: yoon I am running Ubuntu 16.04 in my P50. I use a dual boot configuration, using one SSD with Windows 10, and one SSD with Linux. The only issue I currently have with Ubuntu is the size of the controls in the 4K display. Also, using the built-in 4K display together with a lower resolution external display can be problematic. Running Linux in Virtual Box should be no problem. Answered by: subquantic Date published: 2016-08-16 Would like to buy P50 but have a questions. For the second SSD can I purchase Sata SSD and place it in laptop. I am also thinking of going with just one hard drive for now and later adding the SSDs can I use the SSD which I already have. Asked by: Amar From what I remember from my buying experience, you can select two drives, both of which can be whatever you want. They only trouble with that is that it becomes a custom build and the shipping might take a bit longer. I will say, however, that Lenovo delivered on time and as promised. They did a great job and I'm very happy with my machine. Answered by: danevans0724 Date published: 2016-09-08 Best docking system for ThinkPad P50 Asked by: Dan H Thinkpad Workstation Dock. We have about 10 of them around the office for our P50 laptops. Tried one of the USB type C little "universal" docking boxes - I image those will get better - but the one we tried was not stable with the monitors.
