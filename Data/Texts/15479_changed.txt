Product information Specification Bundles 1 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Highlights - Plays the latest games and PC classics at medium/high settings wherever you are - Quad-core Intel® Core™ i5 processor handles whatever you can throw at it - Hard drive and SSD storage give you the capacity and extra speed you need for serious computing - USB-C is ready for the latest accessories and peripherals NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M The Asus ROG GL55 has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M graphics card which runs many of the latest games at medium to high graphics settings at above 30 frames-per-second (FPS). If you play less demanding games, such as League of Legends or Fallout 1 & 2, you can turn the settings right up and enjoy them at their best. Powerful processing Processing comes courtesy of a 6th generation quad-core Intel® Core™ i5 processor. Alongside being fast enough to not hold the graphics card back, it's easily capable of running demanding creative and design software. High-tech storage Alongside the large-capacity 1 TB hard drive, the ROG GL55 has a super-fast 128 GB solid-state drive that's ideal for installing your games to for much faster loading. There's even enough space to install the OS for faster booting and smoother overall operating. USB-C USB-C is the fastest USB connection ever. When USB-C accessories become available the ROG GL55 is ready thanks to a side-mounted port. It also has USB 3.0, a DVD drive, and an SD card ready to make connecting all your other accessories simple. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
