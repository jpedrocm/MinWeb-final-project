Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by KN1015 Great Business Laptop My HP Envy 13" is an excellent Ultrabook. I've been using mine for alost 6-months now and I have not experienced one issue. Build quality is outstanding and I love the thin, industrial styling. Thank you HP for building a premium product without a touch screen which, for most business users, is a pretty useless feature. I travel every week and the HP Envy is super light and ultraportable. Display and sound quality are terrific as well. June 4, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Suman Good one I like this product, worth the money. The laptop gets overheated sometimes. I think its because of windows settings. Is it possible to get Linux pre-installed on this one? May 28, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris16 Well built and amazing performance in response to the other reviews this product is well built and is very powerful and i have the better model for power but yes it gets warm but never like what you are describing and this laptop is so much better than a macbook for so much less money, i use it every day and also use mac's at college and it performs better and has never broke down. May 21, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Haris HP stands for Heating Problem. I have Been using MacBook Air for last 5 year, and I was really happy with my MacBook air. Recently, I got this laptop from HP, and I'm on my 3rd laptop in less than 3 month,s and I still I'm running to issues with this unit. This unit is running really hot, really hot, even when I'm just using Internet Explore for just browsing. I wont recommend this product to anyone or I'll never buy HP product ever again. March 9, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Jennihanlee Poor Quality Brought one for my wife. The plastic strip that holds the screen started peeling off. Returned this one for a new one. The second one has screen edge problem like the one reviewer talked about. I had to return this one too. Need to build a better computer for this about of $$$$ March 5, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by SinaSanei Poor quality check and built I bought this laptop hoping to see something fascinating but...! QHD display has a lot of light bleeding especially at the top left corner, and apparently it is not only mine. the device gets too hot even with simple web browsing even after the BIOS update. Speakers are way to bad, they vibrate the keyboard and you hear a constant noise while listening to something However, other than this problems it is not a bad ultrabook. Performance is good, although the SSD speed is below average of ultrabook class.

Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by KN1015 Great Business Laptop My HP Envy 13" is an excellent Ultrabook. I've been using mine for alost 6-months now and I have not experienced one issue. Build quality is outstanding and I love the thin, industrial styling. Thank you HP for building a premium product without a touch screen which, for most business users, is a pretty useless feature. I travel every week and the HP Envy is super light and ultraportable. Display and sound quality are terrific as well. June 4, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Suman Good one I like this product, worth the money. The laptop gets overheated sometimes. I think its because of windows settings. Is it possible to get Linux pre-installed on this one? May 28, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris16 Well built and amazing performance in response to the other reviews this product is well built and is very powerful and i have the better model for power but yes it gets warm but never like what you are describing and this laptop is so much better than a macbook for so much less money, i use it every day and also use mac's at college and it performs better and has never broke down. May 21, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Haris HP stands for Heating Problem. I have Been using MacBook Air for last 5 year, and I was really happy with my MacBook air. Recently, I got this laptop from HP, and I'm on my 3rd laptop in less than 3 month,s and I still I'm running to issues with this unit. This unit is running really hot, really hot, even when I'm just using Internet Explore for just browsing. I wont recommend this product to anyone or I'll never buy HP product ever again. March 9, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Jennihanlee Poor Quality Brought one for my wife. The plastic strip that holds the screen started peeling off. Returned this one for a new one. The second one has screen edge problem like the one reviewer talked about. I had to return this one too. Need to build a better computer for this about of $$$$ March 5, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by SinaSanei Poor quality check and built I bought this laptop hoping to see something fascinating but...! QHD display has a lot of light bleeding especially at the top left corner, and apparently it is not only mine. the device gets too hot even with simple web browsing even after the BIOS update. Speakers are way to bad, they vibrate the keyboard and you hear a constant noise while listening to something However, other than this problems it is not a bad ultrabook. Performance is good, although the SSD speed is below average of ultrabook class.

Display and sound quality are terrific as well. June 4, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Suman Good one I like this product, worth the money. The laptop gets overheated sometimes.

Product reviews Showing out of reviews. Write a review Read all reviews Rated 5 out of 5 by KN1015 Great Business Laptop My HP Envy 13" is an excellent Ultrabook. I've been using mine for alost 6-months now and I have not experienced one issue. Build quality is outstanding and I love the thin, industrial styling. Thank you HP for building a premium product without a touch screen which, for most business users, is a pretty useless feature. I travel every week and the HP Envy is super light and ultraportable. Display and sound quality are terrific as well. June 4, 2016 Rated 4 out of 5 by Suman Good one I like this product, worth the money. The laptop gets overheated sometimes. I think its because of windows settings. Is it possible to get Linux pre-installed on this one? May 28, 2016 Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris16 Well built and amazing performance in response to the other reviews this product is well built and is very powerful and i have the better model for power but yes it gets warm but never like what you are describing and this laptop is so much better than a macbook for so much less money, i use it every day and also use mac's at college and it performs better and has never broke down. May 21, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by Haris HP stands for Heating Problem. I have Been using MacBook Air for last 5 year, and I was really happy with my MacBook air. Recently, I got this laptop from HP, and I'm on my 3rd laptop in less than 3 month,s and I still I'm running to issues with this unit. This unit is running really hot, really hot, even when I'm just using Internet Explore for just browsing. I wont recommend this product to anyone or I'll never buy HP product ever again.

Need to build a better computer for this about of $$$$ March 5, 2016 Rated 1 out of 5 by SinaSanei Poor quality check and built I bought this laptop hoping to see something fascinating but...! QHD display has a lot of light bleeding especially at the top left corner, and apparently it is not only mine. the device gets too hot even with simple web browsing even after the BIOS update. Speakers are way to bad, they vibrate the keyboard and you hear a constant noise while listening to something However, other than this problems it is not a bad ultrabook.
