Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles 1 Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Top features: - Solid aluminium chassis with sophisticated spun-metal finish - 360-degree rotatable display lets you switch between laptop and tablet mode - Ultra thin and light for taking with you anywhere - Intel® Core™ processor for working productively - Impressive battery life of up to 12 hours for all-day use Style The UX360CA is part of our Style range, which has beautifully-crafted premium PCs designed to impress. Along with everyday computing, it's great for photo & video editing, working on the go, business use, and multimedia. Sophisticated design Crafted from solid aluminium, the ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360CA is both sophisticated and strong. Finished with a zen-inspired pattern of concentric circles, the UX360 has a timeless and elegant design. 2 in 1 Work and play the way you want – the ZenBook Flip effortlessly switches between laptop and tablet mode with a smooth 360-degree hinge that securely holds the display at any angle. Work anywhere Whether on location, commuting, or in the office, the UX360 is portable enough to be taken anywhere. Ultra-thin at just under 14 mm and ultra-light at 1.3 kg, it's easy to slip into your bag and be on your way. Intel® Core™ processing Quick and nimble, the Intel® Core™ m5 Processor keeps things running smoothly for working across documents or browsing the web, while TurboBoost delivers the power it needs for more demanding applications like photo editing. 12-hour battery The power-efficient processor and high-capacity battery means the ZenBook Flip can last for up to 12 hours between charges, for all-day use. Zero distractions The innovative fanless design means the UX360 is virtually silent so you can work without distractions, while staying cool thanks to the ultra-thin chromium-copper alloy heatpipe. Microsoft Office & Internet security The UX360CA doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
