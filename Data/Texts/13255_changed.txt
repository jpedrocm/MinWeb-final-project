A total package of 3GB VRAM handles higher frame refresh rate with ease and is capable of rendering more detailed graphics when running resource-demanding titles. Scoring P9000+ in 3DMARK 11, the P55W v5 with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M gives you a solid edge over other competitors while gaming. 6th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor: Better Performance Through and Through. The new 6th Generation Intel Core i7 processor features the Intel Skylake architecture with 14nm process, giving you blazing speed and performance which will complete your computing experience. With this new boost in performance, you can do more on your laptop ranging from work to play. Never worry about the battery life as this chip consumes 78% less power than the previous 5th Generation Broadwell chip. Together with PCIe SSD, DDR4 memory, USB 3.1 Type-C and HDMI 2.0, Skylake allows you to start gaming right away! Massive Dual-storage with Speed in Overdrive (optional) The P55W v5 is equipped with 256 GB M.2 SSD and 1TB HDD capacity. Innovative PCI Express SSD technology with the next generation form factor, M.2 is the newest incarnation of the solid state drive. With a single drive having a read speed reaching 2000 MB/s, the M.2 easily is 4x faster than any traditional SATA SSD technology available.

Moreover, system boot speed increases, thus greatly improving and accelerating the user experience! * The storage size may differ between different countries and regions. Please confirm with the local dealers or retailers for the latest specifications. DDR4: Data Storage’s Limit Breaker DDR4 is breaking through the limits of data storage. Better than its predecessor DDR3 in every way, DDR4 is essential for any high-resolution game, or data-intensive application. It runs at a frequency of 2133 MHz, which allows games to run faster and smoother like never before! DDR4 also possesses more storage with a max capacity of 16GB per stick, double that of DDR3.

HDMI 2.0: Higher Frame Rate, Higher Potential The era of true 4K Ultra-HD is upon us! The untapped potential of 4K resolutions is realized through HDMI 2.0! Unlike HDMI 1.4 which only supports 8-bit color and 30 FPS, HDMI 2.0 can display games like never before! Supporting up to 18 Gbps transfer, the true potential of 4K resolution is realized through 12-bit color and 60Hz refresh rate! Finally see your favorite games how they were meant to be seen, in true high definition! *Requires HDCP 2.2 supported monitors USB 3.1 Type-C: Upgraded Convenience The frustrations of turning a USB over and over trying to get it to plug has ended.

A total package of 3GB VRAM handles higher frame refresh rate with ease and is capable of rendering more detailed graphics when running resource-demanding titles. Scoring P9000+ in 3DMARK 11, the P55W v5 with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M gives you a solid edge over other competitors while gaming. 6th Gen Intel Core i7 Processor: Better Performance Through and Through. The new 6th Generation Intel Core i7 processor features the Intel Skylake architecture with 14nm process, giving you blazing speed and performance which will complete your computing experience. With this new boost in performance, you can do more on your laptop ranging from work to play. Never worry about the battery life as this chip consumes 78% less power than the previous 5th Generation Broadwell chip. Together with PCIe SSD, DDR4 memory, USB 3.1 Type-C and HDMI 2.0, Skylake allows you to start gaming right away! Massive Dual-storage with Speed in Overdrive (optional) The P55W v5 is equipped with 256 GB M.2 SSD and 1TB HDD capacity. Innovative PCI Express SSD technology with the next generation form factor, M.2 is the newest incarnation of the solid state drive. With a single drive having a read speed reaching 2000 MB/s, the M.2 easily is 4x faster than any traditional SATA SSD technology available. With this boost in speed, the loading and installing time for programs and games will be greatly decreased. Moreover, system boot speed increases, thus greatly improving and accelerating the user experience! * The storage size may differ between different countries and regions. Please confirm with the local dealers or retailers for the latest specifications. DDR4: Data Storage’s Limit Breaker DDR4 is breaking through the limits of data storage. Better than its predecessor DDR3 in every way, DDR4 is essential for any high-resolution game, or data-intensive application. It runs at a frequency of 2133 MHz, which allows games to run faster and smoother like never before! DDR4 also possesses more storage with a max capacity of 16GB per stick, double that of DDR3. Whether you are gaming or working, DDR4 will be able to provide superior performance! Full HD Wide View Display for Crisp & Rich Vision The 1080p Full HD display with great viewing angle realizes premium viewing experience plus astonishing color accuracy and crystal clear images when screen sharing.

HDMI 2.0: Higher Frame Rate, Higher Potential The era of true 4K Ultra-HD is upon us! The untapped potential of 4K resolutions is realized through HDMI 2.0! Unlike HDMI 1.4 which only supports 8-bit color and 30 FPS, HDMI 2.0 can display games like never before! Supporting up to 18 Gbps transfer, the true potential of 4K resolution is realized through 12-bit color and 60Hz refresh rate! Finally see your favorite games how they were meant to be seen, in true high definition! *Requires HDCP 2.2 supported monitors USB 3.1 Type-C: Upgraded Convenience The frustrations of turning a USB over and over trying to get it to plug has ended. With the introduction of USB 3.1 Type-C universal connector, connecting a USB is no longer a fuss.
