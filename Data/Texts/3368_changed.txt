Instead...everything is advertisements and do overs. It is not simple o use, it is an annoying product. My printer does not work with it, my email is not easy to access. I hate it, I hate it.

Whenever I tun it on, get message on screen saying "You aren't connect to the internet." Have to put in my wireless network key numbers to get back up online. Don't know why this happens. Might have to use this as a boat anchor if it happen again.

By D from Boonton, N.J. Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: After reviewing many laptops it became clear that this was the piece to buy. Great features, extremely fast, very light, long battery life, large easy to read screen and priced right. It's features perform flawlessly. It's memory is large enough to run even large projects easily. And if you've never used windows 8.1, this machine makes it easy. I have another computer which runs windows 7 and I don't even want to use it anymore. I only gave it a 4 star rating on features is because it's not a touch screen. That would complete this nearly perfect package.

As a new user to Win 8.1 I was a bit apprehensive about diving in from Win 7. However, Toshiba made it simple and quick to get going. The laptop itself has a nice array of features like CD/DVD drive, camera, mike, adequate USB ports and HDMI port. Reasonably quick, good screen resolution. The only downside is the sound quality is mediocre at best. However, I have other devices to deal with that. Overall, I really like this machine.

By D from Boonton, N.J. Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: After reviewing many laptops it became clear that this was the piece to buy. Great features, extremely fast, very light, long battery life, large easy to read screen and priced right. It's features perform flawlessly. It's memory is large enough to run even large projects easily. And if you've never used windows 8.1, this machine makes it easy. I have another computer which runs windows 7 and I don't even want to use it anymore. I only gave it a 4 star rating on features is because it's not a touch screen. That would complete this nearly perfect package.

As a new user to Win 8.1 I was a bit apprehensive about diving in from Win 7. However, Toshiba made it simple and quick to get going. The laptop itself has a nice array of features like CD/DVD drive, camera, mike, adequate USB ports and HDMI port. Reasonably quick, good screen resolution. The only downside is the sound quality is mediocre at best. However, I have other devices to deal with that. Overall, I really like this machine.

Product Overview? Back to Top The 15.6" Satellite C55-B5296 Series Notebook with Windows 8.1 with Bing from Toshiba features a textured resin design with a jet black finish. The 15.6" TruBrite LED-backlit display has a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1366 x 768 native resolution with native support for 720p HD content. You can also output video to an external display via the HDMI or VGA port. The system is powered by a 2.16 GHz Intel Celeron N2830 Dual-Core processor. It also has 4GB of 1333 MHz DDR3L RAM, a 500GB 5400 rpm hard drive, a SuperMulti DVD burner, a multi-format media card reader, Ethernet RJ-45 LAN, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, an integrated webcam, and dual microphones. There are also built-in stereo speakers. Windows 8.1 with Bing is the installed operating system. Windows 8.1 improves the user experience of Windows 8 with several additions and changes. The Start button returns, but has two limited core functions. A left click takes you to the redesigned Start screen featuring tiles that update in real-time. A right click brings up an advanced menu where you can access the Device Manager, Control Panel and more. You will also be able to boot directly to the traditional desktop screen instead of the Windows 8.1 Start screen. Windows 8.1 provides a unique user experience that differs from previous versions of Windows.   Documents   'Owner's Manual'     'Specification Sheet'   Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed...

By D from Boonton, N.J. Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: After reviewing many laptops it became clear that this was the piece to buy. Great features, extremely fast, very light, long battery life, large easy to read screen and priced right. It's features perform flawlessly. It's memory is large enough to run even large projects easily. And if you've never used windows 8.1, this machine makes it easy. I have another computer which runs windows 7 and I don't even want to use it anymore. I only gave it a 4 star rating on features is because it's not a touch screen. That would complete this nearly perfect package.

As a new user to Win 8.1 I was a bit apprehensive about diving in from Win 7. However, Toshiba made it simple and quick to get going. The laptop itself has a nice array of features like CD/DVD drive, camera, mike, adequate USB ports and HDMI port. Reasonably quick, good screen resolution. The only downside is the sound quality is mediocre at best. However, I have other devices to deal with that. Overall, I really like this machine.

By D from Boonton, N.J. Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: After reviewing many laptops it became clear that this was the piece to buy. Great features, extremely fast, very light, long battery life, large easy to read screen and priced right. It's features perform flawlessly. It's memory is large enough to run even large projects easily. And if you've never used windows 8.1, this machine makes it easy. I have another computer which runs windows 7 and I don't even want to use it anymore. I only gave it a 4 star rating on features is because it's not a touch screen. That would complete this nearly perfect package.

The laptop itself has a nice array of features like CD/DVD drive, camera, mike, adequate USB ports and HDMI port. Reasonably quick, good screen resolution.

4/26/2015   5.0 Best value out there!! By D from Boonton, N.J. Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: After reviewing many laptops it became clear that this was the piece to buy. Great features, extremely fast, very light, long battery life, large easy to read screen and priced right. It's features perform flawlessly. It's memory is large enough to run even large projects easily. And if you've never used windows 8.1, this machine makes it easy. I have another computer which runs windows 7 and I don't even want to use it anymore. I only gave it a 4 star rating on features is because it's not a touch screen. That would complete this nearly perfect package.

4/23/2015   4.0 Solid Value for The Price By Jay from La Veta, CO Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: This is a really nice laptop. As a new user to Win 8.1 I was a bit apprehensive about diving in from Win 7. However, Toshiba made it simple and quick to get going. The laptop itself has a nice array of features like CD/DVD drive, camera, mike, adequate USB ports and HDMI port. Reasonably quick, good screen resolution. The only downside is the sound quality is mediocre at best. However, I have other devices to deal with that. Overall, I really like this machine. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review
