Product information Specification Customer reviews Bundles Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 8 Product information Top features: - Intel® Celeron™ processor for reliable, everyday computing - Weighs just 1.9 kg with a lightweight feel - USB-C for super-fast connectivity - SonicMaster sound technology for high quality audio Social The X540 is part of our Social range, which features great-value laptops designed to keep you connected to what matters. Perfect typing up an essay, browsing online and checking in on social media. Processing for day to day use For smooth and responsive computing, the Asus X540 is powered by an Intel® Celeron™ processor, so you can browse online and catch up with friends easily. Using Smart Gesture technology, you can control the X540 with the same intuitive way you use a smartphone. The highly sensitive touch page lets you pinch to zoom in, swipe, tap and scroll naturally. Solid yet lightweight design The X540 has a solid build without being bulky, finished with a premium brushed look that is sure to stand out wherever you are. Perfect for taking with you around the house with you, the lightweight chassis weighs only 1.9 kg. Prevent heat building up under the palm rest, the X540 has IceCool technology to keep the laptop surface comfortably cool, even after hours of use. USB-C Connectivity Connect faster than ever with the new USB Type-C port, which has a reversible design so you don't have to figure out which way to connect your USB devices. Able to transfer a 2 GB film in less than two seconds, USB Type-C lets you transfer at speeds of up to 5 GB/s. Audio and visual technology For precise, high quality sound, the X540 features SonicMaster technology. Professional software is paired with large speakers, an amplifier and resonance chambers for powerful audio and deep bass. Enjoy every song on your favourite playlists and watch movies with clear, fine-tuned audio. Asus Splendid Technology uses colour correction for richer, deeper colour to create great quality imagery. With four visual modes, you can optimise your screen to enhance every photo, video and film. If you're reading for a long period of time, Eye Care mode is ideal, reducing the amount of fatiguing blue light. Microsoft Office & internet security The  X540 doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
