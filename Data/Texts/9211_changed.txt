The biggest downside is the placement of the right shift key. It is so far away from where the hand naturally goes. I knew there was no way I would be able to get used to it, so instead I reprogrammed the keyboard so the shift key is actually where the up arrow key is. I then moved the up arrow key to where the shift key originally was. Then I popped off the two keys and swapped them, since they're the same size. Problem solved! Lenovo really needs to rethink the keyboard layout, but at least there is that workaround. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Vikki from Keyboard My husband and I have owned many Lenovo computers and have been faithful customers. We just purchased the Lenovo Ideapad 510 and set it up today. This is a great computer except that the shift key for the right hand has been moved so it is difficult and awkward to reach. For people who have typed for years, their fingers automatically go to the position where the keys should be. Now, I have to stop and think each time I need to use the right shift key. Very annoying! Why would Lenovo change the basic keyboard in this way? Date published: 2016-06-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by csw15905 from Great laptop at a great price..... This laptop is well built and light weight. It looks and feels tough and durable not cheap. It does exactly what I need it to do and this model is perfect for my needs so I'm not going to nit pick like many reviews on products. I picked the package and this laptop does exactly what it is intended to do at the speed and performance it was built for with Lenovo quality. I own 5 different Lenovo laptops and all are superior to the other brands out there. You can't go wrong with this laptop for your college student, for work or for home use and the price is right.

How much does this laptop weigh? Asked by: Ash294 Hello weight is 2.1kg (4.63lb) Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-23 Is the brand a touch screen laptop? Asked by: Gift no. it's not. Answered by: kokovacs Date published: 2016-09-27 Do we need to order office software..why one copy is not included with Laptop? Asked by: RSidd Yes, you need to order office software. However, I don't recommend this laptop. I really enjoyed it when I got it -- it is fast, a good price, and pretty. But within a month it's crashed twice and has gotten the "blue screen of death" three times. I returned it today and wanted to post a review, but it won't let me, so I'm reviewing it here. If you buy it I hope you have better luck than I did!

The biggest downside is the placement of the right shift key. It is so far away from where the hand naturally goes. I knew there was no way I would be able to get used to it, so instead I reprogrammed the keyboard so the shift key is actually where the up arrow key is. I then moved the up arrow key to where the shift key originally was. Then I popped off the two keys and swapped them, since they're the same size. Problem solved! Lenovo really needs to rethink the keyboard layout, but at least there is that workaround. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Vikki from Keyboard My husband and I have owned many Lenovo computers and have been faithful customers. We just purchased the Lenovo Ideapad 510 and set it up today. This is a great computer except that the shift key for the right hand has been moved so it is difficult and awkward to reach. For people who have typed for years, their fingers automatically go to the position where the keys should be. Now, I have to stop and think each time I need to use the right shift key. Very annoying! Why would Lenovo change the basic keyboard in this way? Date published: 2016-06-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by csw15905 from Great laptop at a great price..... This laptop is well built and light weight. It looks and feels tough and durable not cheap. It does exactly what I need it to do and this model is perfect for my needs so I'm not going to nit pick like many reviews on products. I picked the package and this laptop does exactly what it is intended to do at the speed and performance it was built for with Lenovo quality. I own 5 different Lenovo laptops and all are superior to the other brands out there. You can't go wrong with this laptop for your college student, for work or for home use and the price is right.

How much does this laptop weigh? Asked by: Ash294 Hello weight is 2.1kg (4.63lb) Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-23 Is the brand a touch screen laptop? Asked by: Gift no. it's not. Answered by: kokovacs Date published: 2016-09-27 Do we need to order office software..why one copy is not included with Laptop? Asked by: RSidd Yes, you need to order office software. However, I don't recommend this laptop. I really enjoyed it when I got it -- it is fast, a good price, and pretty. But within a month it's crashed twice and has gotten the "blue screen of death" three times. I returned it today and wanted to post a review, but it won't let me, so I'm reviewing it here. If you buy it I hope you have better luck than I did!

Rated 4 out of 5 by lenovoproblemsolver from Nice, except for the keyboard I got this laptop yesterday so haven't really put it through its paces yet. The biggest downside is the placement of the right shift key. It is so far away from where the hand naturally goes. I knew there was no way I would be able to get used to it, so instead I reprogrammed the keyboard so the shift key is actually where the up arrow key is. I then moved the up arrow key to where the shift key originally was. Then I popped off the two keys and swapped them, since they're the same size. Problem solved! Lenovo really needs to rethink the keyboard layout, but at least there is that workaround. Date published: 2016-08-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by Vikki from Keyboard My husband and I have owned many Lenovo computers and have been faithful customers. We just purchased the Lenovo Ideapad 510 and set it up today. This is a great computer except that the shift key for the right hand has been moved so it is difficult and awkward to reach. For people who have typed for years, their fingers automatically go to the position where the keys should be. Now, I have to stop and think each time I need to use the right shift key. Very annoying! Why would Lenovo change the basic keyboard in this way? Date published: 2016-06-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by csw15905 from Great laptop at a great price..... This laptop is well built and light weight. It looks and feels tough and durable not cheap. It does exactly what I need it to do and this model is perfect for my needs so I'm not going to nit pick like many reviews on products. I picked the package and this laptop does exactly what it is intended to do at the speed and performance it was built for with Lenovo quality. I own 5 different Lenovo laptops and all are superior to the other brands out there. You can't go wrong with this laptop for your college student, for work or for home use and the price is right.

I'm a college student and it's really important that the laptop is lightweight. How much does this laptop weigh? Asked by: Ash294 Hello weight is 2.1kg (4.63lb) Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-23 Is the brand a touch screen laptop? Asked by: Gift no. it's not. Answered by: kokovacs Date published: 2016-09-27 Do we need to order office software..why one copy is not included with Laptop? Asked by: RSidd Yes, you need to order office software. However, I don't recommend this laptop. I really enjoyed it when I got it -- it is fast, a good price, and pretty. But within a month it's crashed twice and has gotten the "blue screen of death" three times. I returned it today and wanted to post a review, but it won't let me, so I'm reviewing it here. If you buy it I hope you have better luck than I did!
