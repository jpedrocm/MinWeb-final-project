It's great and lightweight to carry around and very flexible with its modes. Sadly it only has 2 USB ports and a micro HDMI for presentations. However without a cooling pad this lil' bugger gets too hot and my right speaker paid the price (no sound coming from it, only left works). I was wondering where could I have the speakers fixed? Could the ports be expanded/changed? Can I upgrade to 8GB RAM from 4GB? Can I have my memory of 500GB to 1TB for more storage? Lastly, can I upgrade my processor from i3 to i7? Date published: 2016-09-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by Robdoc from Good mobile workstation I work with the US military which requires me to be highly mobile pretty frequently. I was nervous about purchasing this laptop but I can honestly say i'm incredibly pleased with the purchase. I love going from typing notes down, to viewing PDFs as if i'm on a tablet within a second. I'ts incredibly convenient. The laptop also seems incredibly sturdy and stands up against the beating I give it throughout the work day Date published: 2016-08-21 Rated 1 out of 5 by labslcn from Had a lot of potential...lemon What would have been a perfect machine has been the perfect nightmare. Before the first year was over I had to have the motherboard replaced. At two years old and no warranty left neither usb port works, I cant connect to a printer wirelessly or hard wired, I can no longer swipe or highlight anything on the screen, it drops wifi connection at least twice a day and very slow. It had the potential to be everything I needed in a laptop, very disappointed.

Asked by: EricW Hello, The Yoga 2 11 has the following ports: USB 3.0 x 1, USB 2.0 x 1, Micro HDMI-out. As long as your Mac monitor can connect via one of the following ports, then you will be able to use that monitor as a display, or purchase an adapter. Thank you for your question, have a great day! Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-23 I am looking for a good laptop for uploading to store/edit & organizing my photos. Is this a good model for photos? Asked by: 4Miss The YOGA 2 11 is fine for editing jpg files using the built-in Win 10 editor and there's plenty of room for storage. I wouldn't recommend it for running a full version of Photoshop using RAW files, though. That will require a little more horsepower.We love the YOGA and the fact that there are USB ports for extra hard drive storage. Answered by: emo1439 Date published: 2016-09-22 Can I upgrade it from i3 to i7? Asked by: Arty Hello, no this model's processor is not upgradable. Thank you for your question, have a great day!

It's great and lightweight to carry around and very flexible with its modes. Sadly it only has 2 USB ports and a micro HDMI for presentations. However without a cooling pad this lil' bugger gets too hot and my right speaker paid the price (no sound coming from it, only left works). I was wondering where could I have the speakers fixed? Could the ports be expanded/changed? Can I upgrade to 8GB RAM from 4GB? Can I have my memory of 500GB to 1TB for more storage? Lastly, can I upgrade my processor from i3 to i7? Date published: 2016-09-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by Robdoc from Good mobile workstation I work with the US military which requires me to be highly mobile pretty frequently. I was nervous about purchasing this laptop but I can honestly say i'm incredibly pleased with the purchase. I love going from typing notes down, to viewing PDFs as if i'm on a tablet within a second. I'ts incredibly convenient. The laptop also seems incredibly sturdy and stands up against the beating I give it throughout the work day Date published: 2016-08-21 Rated 1 out of 5 by labslcn from Had a lot of potential...lemon What would have been a perfect machine has been the perfect nightmare. Before the first year was over I had to have the motherboard replaced. At two years old and no warranty left neither usb port works, I cant connect to a printer wirelessly or hard wired, I can no longer swipe or highlight anything on the screen, it drops wifi connection at least twice a day and very slow. It had the potential to be everything I needed in a laptop, very disappointed.

Asked by: EricW Hello, The Yoga 2 11 has the following ports: USB 3.0 x 1, USB 2.0 x 1, Micro HDMI-out. As long as your Mac monitor can connect via one of the following ports, then you will be able to use that monitor as a display, or purchase an adapter. Thank you for your question, have a great day! Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-23 I am looking for a good laptop for uploading to store/edit & organizing my photos. Is this a good model for photos? Asked by: 4Miss The YOGA 2 11 is fine for editing jpg files using the built-in Win 10 editor and there's plenty of room for storage. I wouldn't recommend it for running a full version of Photoshop using RAW files, though. That will require a little more horsepower.We love the YOGA and the fact that there are USB ports for extra hard drive storage. Answered by: emo1439 Date published: 2016-09-22 Can I upgrade it from i3 to i7? Asked by: Arty Hello, no this model's processor is not upgradable. Thank you for your question, have a great day!

Rated 4 out of 5 by Arty from Lots of areas good & lots of areas need to improve I have an i3 Yoga 2 11. It's great and lightweight to carry around and very flexible with its modes. Sadly it only has 2 USB ports and a micro HDMI for presentations. However without a cooling pad this lil' bugger gets too hot and my right speaker paid the price (no sound coming from it, only left works). I was wondering where could I have the speakers fixed? Could the ports be expanded/changed? Can I upgrade to 8GB RAM from 4GB? Can I have my memory of 500GB to 1TB for more storage? Lastly, can I upgrade my processor from i3 to i7? Date published: 2016-09-04 Rated 5 out of 5 by Robdoc from Good mobile workstation I work with the US military which requires me to be highly mobile pretty frequently. I was nervous about purchasing this laptop but I can honestly say i'm incredibly pleased with the purchase. I love going from typing notes down, to viewing PDFs as if i'm on a tablet within a second. I'ts incredibly convenient. The laptop also seems incredibly sturdy and stands up against the beating I give it throughout the work day Date published: 2016-08-21 Rated 1 out of 5 by labslcn from Had a lot of potential...lemon What would have been a perfect machine has been the perfect nightmare. Before the first year was over I had to have the motherboard replaced. At two years old and no warranty left neither usb port works, I cant connect to a printer wirelessly or hard wired, I can no longer swipe or highlight anything on the screen, it drops wifi connection at least twice a day and very slow. It had the potential to be everything I needed in a laptop, very disappointed.

Can this connect to a Mac monitor? Asked by: EricW Hello, The Yoga 2 11 has the following ports: USB 3.0 x 1, USB 2.0 x 1, Micro HDMI-out. As long as your Mac monitor can connect via one of the following ports, then you will be able to use that monitor as a display, or purchase an adapter. Thank you for your question, have a great day! Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-09-23 I am looking for a good laptop for uploading to store/edit & organizing my photos. Is this a good model for photos? Asked by: 4Miss The YOGA 2 11 is fine for editing jpg files using the built-in Win 10 editor and there's plenty of room for storage. I wouldn't recommend it for running a full version of Photoshop using RAW files, though. That will require a little more horsepower.We love the YOGA and the fact that there are USB ports for extra hard drive storage.
