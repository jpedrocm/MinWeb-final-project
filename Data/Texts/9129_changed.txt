This review mostly points out some of the more annoying things in my mind. 1. The 2.0 USB ports on the right edge are nearer the front of the base than the DVD drive, so that makes either of those impractical for plugging in a corded mouse, as the cord from the mouse can interfere with the DVD drawer opening and closing. A cordless mouse with only a dongle would be all right, though. 2. As with other computers with a touchpad below the keyboard, when the active touchpad is touched while typing, it can interfere with the typing by placing the insertion point somewhere else. At least with this computer, it wasn't hard to find the place to turn off the touchpad in the settings so I could use the mouse exclusively and do away with the touchpad activation anytime I try to type. For those who want to use the touchpad, but not have it fire up at the slightest touch, the settings do provide a way to set its sensitivity. 3. I bought this computer to replace another 17.3-inch laptop. The keyboard and keypad on this one are all scrunched together, unlike my other one that had separations at a few key places to make it easier to find certain keys. The other keyboard had F1 through F5 in a group, separated from F6 through F10, and such. Also, the arrow keys were separated, slightly, which helped find those just by touch. The numeric keypad, also, was separated slightly, so I didn't have to look down when I switched to the keypad to enter numbers in my spreadsheets. 4. Because of scrunching all the keys next to each other and moving the arrow keys so they encroach on the keypad area, the Lenovo engineers also made the 0 a single-width key on the keypad and moved it to the right, which, to me, constitutes a design flaw. so now I have to remind myself to press the 0 key with my middle finger instead of my index finger, which is the way I've used a keypad for decades. Too often, I press the right arrow key instead of the 0 when I'm working in a spreadsheet and that just moves my insertion point to the next cell and I have to move back and correct the number in the original cell. I'm just glad I'm not being paid by the hour! 5. To scrunch all the keys together, the engineers also made the right Shift key smaller, so I had to adjust my typing to avoid hitting the up arrow instead. 6. NumLock on the keypad is on or off depending on how you set it before turning off the computer last time. This hasn't been too much of an issue, since I rarely turn off the NumLock. I almost always use the keypad numerically, so NumLock is usually on by the time I finish a session and turn off my computer. Lenovo evidently has not provided any other means to set that. 7. The function keys (F1, F2, F3, and so on) have assigned default functions just opposite other computers I've used. The white icons indicate their default functions: F1=speaker mute, F2=lower audio volume, F3=raise audio volume, and so on). On other keyboards, I have had to press the Fn key with the appropriate F key on the top row to get to those functions and the F1, F2, F3, and so on, were the default. I can get used to this, but it is different and may or may not be an issue for you, depending on how you use your keyboard. I can't afford to buy a new computer every year, so I buy based on having a computer that will last me and do what I need to do for several years. I expect this computer will ultimately make the grade. These things I listed are nuisances to me, but I can live with those to have the computing capabilities of this machine. Date published: 2016-07-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by dingus from Good title it let you know what you are getting Have been using this laptop for about a month now. Fast! I have some large slow loading software and it does not even bat an eye. It has window 10 on it and everyone was telling me how difficult 10 is? I had xp before and have had no issues. I did notice that Lenovo does not load it's computer down with all kinds of games and programs most people don't need. Very Clean setup! I would send a picture but my desk is a mess, I use it mostly for work and everybody wants to use it, password protected. As you may have guessed I really like this computer. Just bought 6 Lenovo desktops for work can't wait to get them rolling.

Asked by: Quinkers550 I have owned this Laptop for several weeks. I added 4G memory and for basic home use it is excellent. However, the screen resolution and graphics card would not make this laptop ideal for gaming. Most independent reviews would agree with this.

This review mostly points out some of the more annoying things in my mind. 1. The 2.0 USB ports on the right edge are nearer the front of the base than the DVD drive, so that makes either of those impractical for plugging in a corded mouse, as the cord from the mouse can interfere with the DVD drawer opening and closing. A cordless mouse with only a dongle would be all right, though. 2. As with other computers with a touchpad below the keyboard, when the active touchpad is touched while typing, it can interfere with the typing by placing the insertion point somewhere else. At least with this computer, it wasn't hard to find the place to turn off the touchpad in the settings so I could use the mouse exclusively and do away with the touchpad activation anytime I try to type. For those who want to use the touchpad, but not have it fire up at the slightest touch, the settings do provide a way to set its sensitivity. 3. I bought this computer to replace another 17.3-inch laptop. The keyboard and keypad on this one are all scrunched together, unlike my other one that had separations at a few key places to make it easier to find certain keys. The other keyboard had F1 through F5 in a group, separated from F6 through F10, and such. Also, the arrow keys were separated, slightly, which helped find those just by touch. The numeric keypad, also, was separated slightly, so I didn't have to look down when I switched to the keypad to enter numbers in my spreadsheets. 4. Because of scrunching all the keys next to each other and moving the arrow keys so they encroach on the keypad area, the Lenovo engineers also made the 0 a single-width key on the keypad and moved it to the right, which, to me, constitutes a design flaw. so now I have to remind myself to press the 0 key with my middle finger instead of my index finger, which is the way I've used a keypad for decades. Too often, I press the right arrow key instead of the 0 when I'm working in a spreadsheet and that just moves my insertion point to the next cell and I have to move back and correct the number in the original cell. I'm just glad I'm not being paid by the hour! 5. To scrunch all the keys together, the engineers also made the right Shift key smaller, so I had to adjust my typing to avoid hitting the up arrow instead. 6. NumLock on the keypad is on or off depending on how you set it before turning off the computer last time. This hasn't been too much of an issue, since I rarely turn off the NumLock. I almost always use the keypad numerically, so NumLock is usually on by the time I finish a session and turn off my computer. Lenovo evidently has not provided any other means to set that. 7. The function keys (F1, F2, F3, and so on) have assigned default functions just opposite other computers I've used. The white icons indicate their default functions: F1=speaker mute, F2=lower audio volume, F3=raise audio volume, and so on). On other keyboards, I have had to press the Fn key with the appropriate F key on the top row to get to those functions and the F1, F2, F3, and so on, were the default. I can get used to this, but it is different and may or may not be an issue for you, depending on how you use your keyboard. I can't afford to buy a new computer every year, so I buy based on having a computer that will last me and do what I need to do for several years. I expect this computer will ultimately make the grade. These things I listed are nuisances to me, but I can live with those to have the computing capabilities of this machine. Date published: 2016-07-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by dingus from Good title it let you know what you are getting Have been using this laptop for about a month now. Fast! I have some large slow loading software and it does not even bat an eye. It has window 10 on it and everyone was telling me how difficult 10 is? I had xp before and have had no issues. I did notice that Lenovo does not load it's computer down with all kinds of games and programs most people don't need. Very Clean setup! I would send a picture but my desk is a mess, I use it mostly for work and everybody wants to use it, password protected. As you may have guessed I really like this computer. Just bought 6 Lenovo desktops for work can't wait to get them rolling.

Asked by: Quinkers550 I have owned this Laptop for several weeks. I added 4G memory and for basic home use it is excellent. However, the screen resolution and graphics card would not make this laptop ideal for gaming. Most independent reviews would agree with this. Answered by: newLenovoUser1 Date published: 2016-10-13 What MS Office products are bundled in? Asked by: gwbabble It comes with the operating system.  I chose Windows 10 and it works fine.  You have to purchase Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook extra.  I subscribed to the 2013 version of these and they installed nicely. Answered by: Mike53 Date published: 2016-09-25 How much will cost an order placed on the US Lenovo website and shipped inside the US?. Asked by: Kenia I didn't pay for shipping, but you can pay to have it shipped sooner.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Abhiteja from It's has good processor Bought it about a month ago and enjoying it and happy with it Date published: 2016-10-10 Rated 3 out of 5 by AndyBaurect from Internal muscle, external oddities The capabilities of the machine seem great, but the interface leaves a lot to be desired. This review mostly points out some of the more annoying things in my mind. 1. The 2.0 USB ports on the right edge are nearer the front of the base than the DVD drive, so that makes either of those impractical for plugging in a corded mouse, as the cord from the mouse can interfere with the DVD drawer opening and closing. A cordless mouse with only a dongle would be all right, though. 2. As with other computers with a touchpad below the keyboard, when the active touchpad is touched while typing, it can interfere with the typing by placing the insertion point somewhere else. At least with this computer, it wasn't hard to find the place to turn off the touchpad in the settings so I could use the mouse exclusively and do away with the touchpad activation anytime I try to type. For those who want to use the touchpad, but not have it fire up at the slightest touch, the settings do provide a way to set its sensitivity. 3. I bought this computer to replace another 17.3-inch laptop. The keyboard and keypad on this one are all scrunched together, unlike my other one that had separations at a few key places to make it easier to find certain keys. The other keyboard had F1 through F5 in a group, separated from F6 through F10, and such. Also, the arrow keys were separated, slightly, which helped find those just by touch. The numeric keypad, also, was separated slightly, so I didn't have to look down when I switched to the keypad to enter numbers in my spreadsheets. 4. Because of scrunching all the keys next to each other and moving the arrow keys so they encroach on the keypad area, the Lenovo engineers also made the 0 a single-width key on the keypad and moved it to the right, which, to me, constitutes a design flaw. so now I have to remind myself to press the 0 key with my middle finger instead of my index finger, which is the way I've used a keypad for decades. Too often, I press the right arrow key instead of the 0 when I'm working in a spreadsheet and that just moves my insertion point to the next cell and I have to move back and correct the number in the original cell. I'm just glad I'm not being paid by the hour! 5. To scrunch all the keys together, the engineers also made the right Shift key smaller, so I had to adjust my typing to avoid hitting the up arrow instead. 6. NumLock on the keypad is on or off depending on how you set it before turning off the computer last time. This hasn't been too much of an issue, since I rarely turn off the NumLock. I almost always use the keypad numerically, so NumLock is usually on by the time I finish a session and turn off my computer. Lenovo evidently has not provided any other means to set that. 7. The function keys (F1, F2, F3, and so on) have assigned default functions just opposite other computers I've used. The white icons indicate their default functions: F1=speaker mute, F2=lower audio volume, F3=raise audio volume, and so on). On other keyboards, I have had to press the Fn key with the appropriate F key on the top row to get to those functions and the F1, F2, F3, and so on, were the default. I can get used to this, but it is different and may or may not be an issue for you, depending on how you use your keyboard. I can't afford to buy a new computer every year, so I buy based on having a computer that will last me and do what I need to do for several years. I expect this computer will ultimately make the grade. These things I listed are nuisances to me, but I can live with those to have the computing capabilities of this machine. Date published: 2016-07-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by dingus from Good title it let you know what you are getting Have been using this laptop for about a month now. Fast! I have some large slow loading software and it does not even bat an eye. It has window 10 on it and everyone was telling me how difficult 10 is? I had xp before and have had no issues. I did notice that Lenovo does not load it's computer down with all kinds of games and programs most people don't need. Very Clean setup! I would send a picture but my desk is a mess, I use it mostly for work and everybody wants to use it, password protected. As you may have guessed I really like this computer. Just bought 6 Lenovo desktops for work can't wait to get them rolling.

The keyboard and keypad on this one are all scrunched together, unlike my other one that had separations at a few key places to make it easier to find certain keys. The other keyboard had F1 through F5 in a group, separated from F6 through F10, and such. Also, the arrow keys were separated, slightly, which helped find those just by touch. The numeric keypad, also, was separated slightly, so I didn't have to look down when I switched to the keypad to enter numbers in my spreadsheets. 4. Because of scrunching all the keys next to each other and moving the arrow keys so they encroach on the keypad area, the Lenovo engineers also made the 0 a single-width key on the keypad and moved it to the right, which, to me, constitutes a design flaw. so now I have to remind myself to press the 0 key with my middle finger instead of my index finger, which is the way I've used a keypad for decades. Too often, I press the right arrow key instead of the 0 when I'm working in a spreadsheet and that just moves my insertion point to the next cell and I have to move back and correct the number in the original cell. I'm just glad I'm not being paid by the hour! 5. To scrunch all the keys together, the engineers also made the right Shift key smaller, so I had to adjust my typing to avoid hitting the up arrow instead. 6. NumLock on the keypad is on or off depending on how you set it before turning off the computer last time. This hasn't been too much of an issue, since I rarely turn off the NumLock. I almost always use the keypad numerically, so NumLock is usually on by the time I finish a session and turn off my computer. Lenovo evidently has not provided any other means to set that. 7. The function keys (F1, F2, F3, and so on) have assigned default functions just opposite other computers I've used. The white icons indicate their default functions: F1=speaker mute, F2=lower audio volume, F3=raise audio volume, and so on). On other keyboards, I have had to press the Fn key with the appropriate F key on the top row to get to those functions and the F1, F2, F3, and so on, were the default. I can get used to this, but it is different and may or may not be an issue for you, depending on how you use your keyboard. I can't afford to buy a new computer every year, so I buy based on having a computer that will last me and do what I need to do for several years. I expect this computer will ultimately make the grade. These things I listed are nuisances to me, but I can live with those to have the computing capabilities of this machine.

Rated 5 out of 5 by dingus from Good title it let you know what you are getting Have been using this laptop for about a month now. Fast! I have some large slow loading software and it does not even bat an eye. It has window 10 on it and everyone was telling me how difficult 10 is? I had xp before and have had no issues. I did notice that Lenovo does not load it's computer down with all kinds of games and programs most people don't need. Very Clean setup! I would send a picture but my desk is a mess, I use it mostly for work and everybody wants to use it, password protected. As you may have guessed I really like this computer. Just bought 6 Lenovo desktops for work can't wait to get them rolling. Date published: 2016-08-23

Is it good for gaming? Asked by: Quinkers550 I have owned this Laptop for several weeks. I added 4G memory and for basic home use it is excellent. However, the screen resolution and graphics card would not make this laptop ideal for gaming. Most independent reviews would agree with this. Answered by: newLenovoUser1 Date published: 2016-10-13 What MS Office products are bundled in? Asked by: gwbabble It comes with the operating system.  I chose Windows 10 and it works fine.  You have to purchase Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook extra.  I subscribed to the 2013 version of these and they installed nicely. Answered by: Mike53 Date published: 2016-09-25 How much will cost an order placed on the US Lenovo website and shipped inside the US?. Asked by: Kenia I didn't pay for shipping, but you can pay to have it shipped sooner.
