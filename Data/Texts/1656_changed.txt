The G752VS showcases the evolution of the brand, with a revolutionary design finished in an Armor Titanium and Plasma Copper color scheme. With the latest NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX™ 10 series graphics, Windows 10 Pro, a 6th-generation Intel® Skylake Unlocked Core™ i7 processor, and up to 64GB DDR4 RAM, the ROG G752VS delivers leading overclocked performance that’s built for gaming dominance. G752VS is cooled by dual copper heat pipes and the ROG 3D Vapor Chamber which enables superior overclocking and improved longevity. It even features a backlit anti-ghosting gaming keyboard with 30-key rollover for precise command and control in battle. INTEL® SKYLAKE-K UNLOCKED PROCESSOR WITH NVIDIA® GEFORCE® GTX™ 10 SERIES GPU ROG G752VS gives you unbeatable performance thanks to a 6th-generation Intel® Skylake-K Unlocked Core™ i7 processor. Unlocked Intel® Core™ processors offer an overclocking toolkit for tuning your system the way you want and the G752VS can overclock up to 4GHz. It also features up to the latest NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX™ 1070 GPU with Pascal architecture that delivers game-changing innovations, including next-gen VR and the best energy efficiency. *Actual specification may vary according to configuration. DO MORE WITH WINDOWS 10 PRO ROG G752VS comes with Windows 10 Pro for power-users with business needs. Windows 10 Pro adds improvements that include enhanced encryption with BitLocker, Virtual Machines with Hyper-V, and Remote Log-In. These enterprise features make G752VS the perfect choice as both a gaming rig and workstation desktop replacement. *Actual specification may vary according to configuration. IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL REALITY The VR Ready NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX™ 1070 GPU boosts speed and power efficiency for brilliant performance in Virtual Reality. Enjoy immersive virtual reality that is smooth, low-latency, and stutter-free. -7°C GPU TEMPORATURE -2°C CPU TEMPORATURE 3D VAPOR CHAMBER THERMAL SYSTEM FOR MORE EFFICIENT COOLING The ROG-exclusive 3D Vapor Chamber, together with the copper heat pipe, create an effective and efficient cooling system that helps decrease GPU temperature by up to 7°C. 3D Vapor Chamber technology enables higher-end GPUs with higher TDPs (Thermal Design Power) to be efficiently and effectively cooled to safe operating temperatures, extending component and product life. 3D Vapor Chamber is filled with coolant that, when heated, change phases from a liquid to a gas and back again. It provides stable and evenly spread temperatures on all of its surfaces, regardless of the location and density of the heat source below the chamber base. This makes the ROG-exclusive 3D Vapor Chamber capable of dissipating large wattage heat sources from high-end and overclocked processors. COOLING WITHOUT COMPROMISE ROG G752VS has a unique thermal design that directs dust into a dust-release tunnel to keep it away from internal components. This prolongs component the lifespan and enhances overall stability of the laptop by preventing dusk from clogging the radiator and reducing cooling effectiveness. ROG G752VS has dedicated cooling modules for the CPU and GPU to effectively cool each component. Hot exhaust is efficiently managed and expelled through the rear vents to direct heat away from you for more comfortable gaming sessions. WORLD’S FIRST BACKLIT ANTI-GHOSTING KEYBOARD WITH 30-KEY ROLLOVER Anti-ghosting keys ensure your commands are instantaneously and correctly interpreted - even if you hit up to 30 keys simultaneously. And with 5 dedicated macro keys at your disposal, complex combos can be programmed and executed effortlessly. ROG G752VS has ergonomically-designed keys with 2.5mm of key travel. This gives you greater comfort and accuracy when typing and entering commands - making it easy for you to dominate the battlefield. The illuminated keyboard let you easily type in low light and even in the dark, and the isolated arrow keys provide a desktop-like gaming experience. Best responsiveness WIDE-VIEW PANEL WITH NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ ROG G752VS features super-fast wide-view panels, which delivers superb image quality and contrast even at when viewed from extreme angles. Smooth gaming is enhanced by NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ display technology, which synchronizes the display’s refresh rate with the NVIDIA® GTX™ GPU’s frame rate for ultra-smooth visuals. G-SYNC™ helps avoid lag, minimizes perceived stutter, and eliminates visual tearing. It solved the issues for gamers when using V-Sync: 1. Stuttering since the GPU might render frames at rates other than once every 1/60 sec 2. Input response is fixed and limited to 1/60 sec G-SYNC™ technology delivers the smoothest and fastest gaming graphics - all without affecting system performance! *Actual specification may vary according to configuration. G-SYNC ON G-SYNC OFF No Tearing Reduce Stutter Less Lag +20% Performance Test +30% Active Power Saving FACTORY OVERCLOCKED DRAM WITH INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE ROG G752VS features four DDR4 slots, supporting up to 64GB of RAM. DDR4 has 20% more bandwidth and 30% higher power efficiency than DDR3 memory. The DDR4 RAM in ROG G752VS runs at 2400MHz, 12.5% higher than stock DDR4 speeds. Tested by: AS SSD *Available on selected model with HyperDrive Technology Tested by: IOMeter *Available on selected model with 256GB/512GB NVMe SSD ROG HYPERDRIVE FOR BLAZING-FAST STORAGE SPEEDS ROG HyperDrive uses MLC (Multi-Level Cell) NAND providing better write performance and higher endurance even under intensive workloads. ROG G752VS utilizes the latest NVM Express (NVMe) SSD technology to give you blazing-fast data read and write speeds. Compared to Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), NVMe not only maximizes sequential read and write speeds, but also minimizes random reading and writing latency. The G752VS also comes with dual user-accessible M.2 bays, allowing you to easily upgrade or add additional SSDs. ROG GAMING CENTER The new ROG Gaming Center improves your gaming experience. This integrated control center gives you access to all the functions you need - find system information, set up macros for faster in-game commands, adjust audio settings, or record gameplay from a single dashboard. XSPLIT GAMECASTER ROG G752VS comes with a lifetime XSplit Gamecaster account for you to record or stream games. All it takes it one keystroke for you to get into it and stream your gaming session to the world! SONIC STUDIO & SONIC RADAR ASUS developed Sonic Studio and Sonic Radar for the ROG G752VS. Sonic Studio and Sonic Radar give you immersive gaming audio. Sonic Studio provides high quality gaming audio, as well as improved streaming and audio recording for perfect voice pickup and noise reduction. Sonic Radar helps you detect opponents through an on-screen overlay that shows the relative position of gunshots, footsteps and other in-game sound effects.
