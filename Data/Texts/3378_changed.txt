By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill.

I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one. Highly recommended to road warriors who need a solid, light, fast business laptop.

Only problems that I have found: 1) Touchpad was erratic in some cases. Sometimes it was very small jumps, nothing too bad. However in other cases, especially when the mouse was hovering over the "Samsung Settings" window, it was very very slow. Like something was delaying it. To solve this issue I tried finding the touchpad drivers, but after thorough search and chatting with Samsung Support I discovered the Win10 drivers are not released yet. I downloaded the ELAN drivers from a different model as per Live Chat suggestion, installed them, but issue was still there and no "ELAN" tab was showing in Device Manager. Solution to erratic motion was to do a Samsung Recovery to factory settings and re-install all my programs; then mouse seems to work ok (however note: there are still no touchpad drivers or "ELAN" tab in the "Mouse properties" window). It is not a critical thing but was an inconvenience to reinstall everything again. 2) The metal "frame" surrounding the screen, on its bottom side, is a bit bent. I mean, it has some small gap between the screen and the metal in some locations. Like a tiny "ripple", with the metal not properly glued to the screen. When touched by finger, the metal bends slightly. It is not critical, but it does not give a quality feeling. I hope the ripple does not get worse. Overall is a very nice laptop and very responsive, fast, amazingly thin and light. Only the two issues reported above.

The first thinnest 15 inch laptop in the world with compact body that doesn't have thick and fat screen bezel. It can fit in a 14 inch laptop case. It is also the second lightest 15 inch laptop in the world in 2016. The "LG Gram 15" laptop took the crown as the first lightest 15 inch laptop weighing at 2.1 lbs vs this laptop at 2.9 lbs. This laptop has a very nice, smooth, and responsive touchpad. The keyboard feels nice and easy to type on. The screen looks nice. It runs completely quiet when doing basic tasks. Ramp it up and you can barely hear it. It also runs very cool vs all other laptop that runs hot. However, there are lots of improvements to be made to make this the perfect 15 inch laptop. The battery life doesn't last as long as the 12hr claim. It only lasts me about 5 hours of light use with screen brightness on at 80% which is very disappointing. The screen is not that bright even though it is an IPS panel and it has some small light bleed around the edge when sitting in a perfect dark room. It seems this light bleed issue affect all laptop and desktop monitors out there, except smartphones screen. We want brighter screen. There are still some bezel to trim off further and we want complete bezeless display. The touchpad needs to be smaller and centered with the space bar so users don't accidentally touch it when typing which can screw up the typing process. Most laptop manufacturers weren't even aware of this issue, I'm looking at you engineer and designer. We seriously need a fingerprint reader for the laptop and a backlit keyboard! I can't see the keys sitting in the dark. We also need a standard SD card slot, not a MicroSD. We can't insert a standard SD card into a MicroSD slot, jeeze. What were you thinking Samsung? The webcam is mediocre which has bad quality video. Get rid of it if you can't improve it. If you can move the speakers to the top because the sound will be blocked if I set it on the bed. We also want faster performance as the current performance is not fast enough. Please fix and improve on these reported problem on your next model Samsung. I will be happy to upgrade if you will.

By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review 9/6/2016   5.0 Great successor to the QX-410 By MarvinTheMartian from Undisclosed Pros Bright display Lightweight Realistic color Cons Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: I recently purchased the Notebook 9 (Core I-7) to replace a long in the tooth Samsung QX-410 that I've used for almost 6 years. I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one. Highly recommended to road warriors who need a solid, light, fast business laptop.

Only problems that I have found: 1) Touchpad was erratic in some cases. Sometimes it was very small jumps, nothing too bad. However in other cases, especially when the mouse was hovering over the "Samsung Settings" window, it was very very slow. Like something was delaying it. To solve this issue I tried finding the touchpad drivers, but after thorough search and chatting with Samsung Support I discovered the Win10 drivers are not released yet. I downloaded the ELAN drivers from a different model as per Live Chat suggestion, installed them, but issue was still there and no "ELAN" tab was showing in Device Manager. Solution to erratic motion was to do a Samsung Recovery to factory settings and re-install all my programs; then mouse seems to work ok (however note: there are still no touchpad drivers or "ELAN" tab in the "Mouse properties" window). It is not a critical thing but was an inconvenience to reinstall everything again. 2) The metal "frame" surrounding the screen, on its bottom side, is a bit bent. I mean, it has some small gap between the screen and the metal in some locations. Like a tiny "ripple", with the metal not properly glued to the screen. When touched by finger, the metal bends slightly. It is not critical, but it does not give a quality feeling. I hope the ripple does not get worse. Overall is a very nice laptop and very responsive, fast, amazingly thin and light. Only the two issues reported above.

The first thinnest 15 inch laptop in the world with compact body that doesn't have thick and fat screen bezel. It can fit in a 14 inch laptop case. It is also the second lightest 15 inch laptop in the world in 2016. The "LG Gram 15" laptop took the crown as the first lightest 15 inch laptop weighing at 2.1 lbs vs this laptop at 2.9 lbs. This laptop has a very nice, smooth, and responsive touchpad. The keyboard feels nice and easy to type on. The screen looks nice. It runs completely quiet when doing basic tasks. Ramp it up and you can barely hear it. It also runs very cool vs all other laptop that runs hot. However, there are lots of improvements to be made to make this the perfect 15 inch laptop. The battery life doesn't last as long as the 12hr claim. It only lasts me about 5 hours of light use with screen brightness on at 80% which is very disappointing. The screen is not that bright even though it is an IPS panel and it has some small light bleed around the edge when sitting in a perfect dark room. It seems this light bleed issue affect all laptop and desktop monitors out there, except smartphones screen. We want brighter screen. There are still some bezel to trim off further and we want complete bezeless display. The touchpad needs to be smaller and centered with the space bar so users don't accidentally touch it when typing which can screw up the typing process. Most laptop manufacturers weren't even aware of this issue, I'm looking at you engineer and designer. We seriously need a fingerprint reader for the laptop and a backlit keyboard! I can't see the keys sitting in the dark. We also need a standard SD card slot, not a MicroSD. We can't insert a standard SD card into a MicroSD slot, jeeze. What were you thinking Samsung? The webcam is mediocre which has bad quality video. Get rid of it if you can't improve it. If you can move the speakers to the top because the sound will be blocked if I set it on the bed. We also want faster performance as the current performance is not fast enough. Please fix and improve on these reported problem on your next model Samsung. I will be happy to upgrade if you will.

By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill.

I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one.

By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill.

I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one. Highly recommended to road warriors who need a solid, light, fast business laptop.

Only problems that I have found: 1) Touchpad was erratic in some cases. Sometimes it was very small jumps, nothing too bad. However in other cases, especially when the mouse was hovering over the "Samsung Settings" window, it was very very slow. Like something was delaying it. To solve this issue I tried finding the touchpad drivers, but after thorough search and chatting with Samsung Support I discovered the Win10 drivers are not released yet. I downloaded the ELAN drivers from a different model as per Live Chat suggestion, installed them, but issue was still there and no "ELAN" tab was showing in Device Manager. Solution to erratic motion was to do a Samsung Recovery to factory settings and re-install all my programs; then mouse seems to work ok (however note: there are still no touchpad drivers or "ELAN" tab in the "Mouse properties" window). It is not a critical thing but was an inconvenience to reinstall everything again. 2) The metal "frame" surrounding the screen, on its bottom side, is a bit bent. I mean, it has some small gap between the screen and the metal in some locations. Like a tiny "ripple", with the metal not properly glued to the screen. When touched by finger, the metal bends slightly. It is not critical, but it does not give a quality feeling. I hope the ripple does not get worse. Overall is a very nice laptop and very responsive, fast, amazingly thin and light. Only the two issues reported above.

The first thinnest 15 inch laptop in the world with compact body that doesn't have thick and fat screen bezel. It can fit in a 14 inch laptop case. It is also the second lightest 15 inch laptop in the world in 2016. The "LG Gram 15" laptop took the crown as the first lightest 15 inch laptop weighing at 2.1 lbs vs this laptop at 2.9 lbs. This laptop has a very nice, smooth, and responsive touchpad. The keyboard feels nice and easy to type on. The screen looks nice. It runs completely quiet when doing basic tasks. Ramp it up and you can barely hear it. It also runs very cool vs all other laptop that runs hot. However, there are lots of improvements to be made to make this the perfect 15 inch laptop. The battery life doesn't last as long as the 12hr claim. It only lasts me about 5 hours of light use with screen brightness on at 80% which is very disappointing. The screen is not that bright even though it is an IPS panel and it has some small light bleed around the edge when sitting in a perfect dark room. It seems this light bleed issue affect all laptop and desktop monitors out there, except smartphones screen. We want brighter screen. There are still some bezel to trim off further and we want complete bezeless display. The touchpad needs to be smaller and centered with the space bar so users don't accidentally touch it when typing which can screw up the typing process. Most laptop manufacturers weren't even aware of this issue, I'm looking at you engineer and designer. We seriously need a fingerprint reader for the laptop and a backlit keyboard! I can't see the keys sitting in the dark. We also need a standard SD card slot, not a MicroSD. We can't insert a standard SD card into a MicroSD slot, jeeze. What were you thinking Samsung? The webcam is mediocre which has bad quality video. Get rid of it if you can't improve it. If you can move the speakers to the top because the sound will be blocked if I set it on the bed. We also want faster performance as the current performance is not fast enough. Please fix and improve on these reported problem on your next model Samsung. I will be happy to upgrade if you will.

Product Overview? Back to Top Calling it lightweight is an understatement. Weighing less than 2.9 pounds, the impossibly sleek Samsung NP900X5L-K02US Notebook 9, engineered from aluminum and magnesium alloy, has a micro-thin bezel to maximize the immersive full HD 15" screen. Powered by Windows 10 and the best-in-class Intel® Core™ i7 processor with fast charge capability. It lets you work, watch and play for up to a 12-hour flight from Seattle to Beijing and fill up your battery again in as little as 1.5 hours. The Samsung Notebook 9 may be light, but when it comes to performance, its anything but lightweight.

By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill.

I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one. Highly recommended to road warriors who need a solid, light, fast business laptop.

Only problems that I have found: 1) Touchpad was erratic in some cases. Sometimes it was very small jumps, nothing too bad. However in other cases, especially when the mouse was hovering over the "Samsung Settings" window, it was very very slow. Like something was delaying it. To solve this issue I tried finding the touchpad drivers, but after thorough search and chatting with Samsung Support I discovered the Win10 drivers are not released yet. I downloaded the ELAN drivers from a different model as per Live Chat suggestion, installed them, but issue was still there and no "ELAN" tab was showing in Device Manager. Solution to erratic motion was to do a Samsung Recovery to factory settings and re-install all my programs; then mouse seems to work ok (however note: there are still no touchpad drivers or "ELAN" tab in the "Mouse properties" window). It is not a critical thing but was an inconvenience to reinstall everything again. 2) The metal "frame" surrounding the screen, on its bottom side, is a bit bent. I mean, it has some small gap between the screen and the metal in some locations. Like a tiny "ripple", with the metal not properly glued to the screen. When touched by finger, the metal bends slightly. It is not critical, but it does not give a quality feeling. I hope the ripple does not get worse. Overall is a very nice laptop and very responsive, fast, amazingly thin and light. Only the two issues reported above.

The first thinnest 15 inch laptop in the world with compact body that doesn't have thick and fat screen bezel. It can fit in a 14 inch laptop case. It is also the second lightest 15 inch laptop in the world in 2016. The "LG Gram 15" laptop took the crown as the first lightest 15 inch laptop weighing at 2.1 lbs vs this laptop at 2.9 lbs. This laptop has a very nice, smooth, and responsive touchpad. The keyboard feels nice and easy to type on. The screen looks nice. It runs completely quiet when doing basic tasks. Ramp it up and you can barely hear it. It also runs very cool vs all other laptop that runs hot. However, there are lots of improvements to be made to make this the perfect 15 inch laptop. The battery life doesn't last as long as the 12hr claim. It only lasts me about 5 hours of light use with screen brightness on at 80% which is very disappointing. The screen is not that bright even though it is an IPS panel and it has some small light bleed around the edge when sitting in a perfect dark room. It seems this light bleed issue affect all laptop and desktop monitors out there, except smartphones screen. We want brighter screen. There are still some bezel to trim off further and we want complete bezeless display. The touchpad needs to be smaller and centered with the space bar so users don't accidentally touch it when typing which can screw up the typing process. Most laptop manufacturers weren't even aware of this issue, I'm looking at you engineer and designer. We seriously need a fingerprint reader for the laptop and a backlit keyboard! I can't see the keys sitting in the dark. We also need a standard SD card slot, not a MicroSD. We can't insert a standard SD card into a MicroSD slot, jeeze. What were you thinking Samsung? The webcam is mediocre which has bad quality video. Get rid of it if you can't improve it. If you can move the speakers to the top because the sound will be blocked if I set it on the bed. We also want faster performance as the current performance is not fast enough. Please fix and improve on these reported problem on your next model Samsung. I will be happy to upgrade if you will.

By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill.

I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one. Highly recommended to road warriors who need a solid, light, fast business laptop.

Only problems that I have found: 1) Touchpad was erratic in some cases. Sometimes it was very small jumps, nothing too bad. However in other cases, especially when the mouse was hovering over the "Samsung Settings" window, it was very very slow. Like something was delaying it. To solve this issue I tried finding the touchpad drivers, but after thorough search and chatting with Samsung Support I discovered the Win10 drivers are not released yet. I downloaded the ELAN drivers from a different model as per Live Chat suggestion, installed them, but issue was still there and no "ELAN" tab was showing in Device Manager. Solution to erratic motion was to do a Samsung Recovery to factory settings and re-install all my programs; then mouse seems to work ok (however note: there are still no touchpad drivers or "ELAN" tab in the "Mouse properties" window). It is not a critical thing but was an inconvenience to reinstall everything again. 2) The metal "frame" surrounding the screen, on its bottom side, is a bit bent. I mean, it has some small gap between the screen and the metal in some locations. Like a tiny "ripple", with the metal not properly glued to the screen. When touched by finger, the metal bends slightly. It is not critical, but it does not give a quality feeling. I hope the ripple does not get worse. Overall is a very nice laptop and very responsive, fast, amazingly thin and light. Only the two issues reported above.

The first thinnest 15 inch laptop in the world with compact body that doesn't have thick and fat screen bezel. It can fit in a 14 inch laptop case. It is also the second lightest 15 inch laptop in the world in 2016. The "LG Gram 15" laptop took the crown as the first lightest 15 inch laptop weighing at 2.1 lbs vs this laptop at 2.9 lbs. This laptop has a very nice, smooth, and responsive touchpad. The keyboard feels nice and easy to type on. The screen looks nice. It runs completely quiet when doing basic tasks. Ramp it up and you can barely hear it. It also runs very cool vs all other laptop that runs hot. However, there are lots of improvements to be made to make this the perfect 15 inch laptop. The battery life doesn't last as long as the 12hr claim. It only lasts me about 5 hours of light use with screen brightness on at 80% which is very disappointing. The screen is not that bright even though it is an IPS panel and it has some small light bleed around the edge when sitting in a perfect dark room. It seems this light bleed issue affect all laptop and desktop monitors out there, except smartphones screen. We want brighter screen. There are still some bezel to trim off further and we want complete bezeless display. The touchpad needs to be smaller and centered with the space bar so users don't accidentally touch it when typing which can screw up the typing process. Most laptop manufacturers weren't even aware of this issue, I'm looking at you engineer and designer. We seriously need a fingerprint reader for the laptop and a backlit keyboard! I can't see the keys sitting in the dark. We also need a standard SD card slot, not a MicroSD. We can't insert a standard SD card into a MicroSD slot, jeeze. What were you thinking Samsung? The webcam is mediocre which has bad quality video. Get rid of it if you can't improve it. If you can move the speakers to the top because the sound will be blocked if I set it on the bed. We also want faster performance as the current performance is not fast enough. Please fix and improve on these reported problem on your next model Samsung. I will be happy to upgrade if you will.

9/7/2016   5.0 This laptop is very sleek and stylish, and blazing fast, too! By astrohart from San Diego, CA Pros Bright display Inexpensive Lightweight Realistic color Cons hard drive could be bigger Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: Hi all, I only buy laptops that fit my needs. I can definitely say that this is the case with the Samsung Notebook 9 that I have just purchased. It's fast, it's powerful, and its chassis is very sleek and stylish. I am a scientist and a software consultant, and I am sometimes on the road or needing to do work on the airplane. Presently, I had an old laptop that had a 17" monitor and lots of power and hard disk space, but it was bought in 2010 and was heavy as all get out, bulky, and really big to use on an airplane. So, I went to the electronics store the other day in search of a slim, light laptop that can mostly serve as just a thin sort of client to use to then shell in to my Desktop system at home from the plane or wherever. This laptop, with its small and sleek form factor, incredibly light weight, and powerful processing capabilities, combined with its reasonable price point, very much fit the bill.

9/6/2016   5.0 Great successor to the QX-410 By MarvinTheMartian from Undisclosed Pros Bright display Lightweight Realistic color Cons Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: I recently purchased the Notebook 9 (Core I-7) to replace a long in the tooth Samsung QX-410 that I've used for almost 6 years. I've dragged the QX-410 all over the world, and it has been super rugged, and trouble free. While the QX-410 still works, one of the USB ports was mangled by a fellow air traveler (small USB dongle was in the port) in the overhead bin. Good excuse to upgrade! I have to say that the Notebook 9 is an improvement in every way except storage. I wish Samsung had provided the option for a 512gb SSD, and also the option for Win 10 Pro. Oh well. The Notebook 9 doesn't look to be *quite* as sturdy as the QX-410, but seems very well built and pretty resistant to damage. The screen is beautiful, and the extra 1" diagonal size over the 14" QX-410 is really a plus. As someone who edits documents in side by side mode routinely, the extra size is just right. The Notebook 9 is fast, incredibly light, and the touch pad (the unholy bane of the QX-410) is very responsive and has a great tactile sense. Many reviews I've read knock down the Notebook 9 for having a poor keyboard - short key travel - but for me (admittedly not a speed demon - 8 fingers with arthritis, and 2 missing) - I've noticed a significant increase in my typing speed. Very comfortable to type, and a super easy transition from the QX-410 which has the identical keyboard layout *except* the right hand shift key is much larger on the Notebook 9, and much easier to hit. All in all, I could ask for more storage, and possibly more USB's, but overall this is a much better laptop than the QX-410, and I was very happy with that one. Highly recommended to road warriors who need a solid, light, fast business laptop.

8/13/2016   4.0 My experience with this laptop By CustomerInEurope from Undisclosed Pros Bright display Built-in speakers latest 6th gen i7 very fast Lightweight Realistic color Cons bottom of screen metal frame shows tiny ripple no touchpad drivers Best Uses Comments about Samsung 15" Intel Skylake Laptop Computer: The laptop has a great design, all the inputs/features as described are included and it works very fast being a 6th generation i7 processor. Only problems that I have found: 1) Touchpad was erratic in some cases. Sometimes it was very small jumps, nothing too bad. However in other cases, especially when the mouse was hovering over the "Samsung Settings" window, it was very very slow. Like something was delaying it. To solve this issue I tried finding the touchpad drivers, but after thorough search and chatting with Samsung Support I discovered the Win10 drivers are not released yet. I downloaded the ELAN drivers from a different model as per Live Chat suggestion, installed them, but issue was still there and no "ELAN" tab was showing in Device Manager. Solution to erratic motion was to do a Samsung Recovery to factory settings and re-install all my programs; then mouse seems to work ok (however note: there are still no touchpad drivers or "ELAN" tab in the "Mouse properties" window). It is not a critical thing but was an inconvenience to reinstall everything again. 2) The metal "frame" surrounding the screen, on its bottom side, is a bit bent. I mean, it has some small gap between the screen and the metal in some locations. Like a tiny "ripple", with the metal not properly glued to the screen. When touched by finger, the metal bends slightly. It is not critical, but it does not give a quality feeling. I hope the ripple does not get worse. Overall is a very nice laptop and very responsive, fast, amazingly thin and light. Only the two issues reported above.

The first thinnest 15 inch laptop in the world with compact body that doesn't have thick and fat screen bezel. It can fit in a 14 inch laptop case. It is also the second lightest 15 inch laptop in the world in 2016. The "LG Gram 15" laptop took the crown as the first lightest 15 inch laptop weighing at 2.1 lbs vs this laptop at 2.9 lbs. This laptop has a very nice, smooth, and responsive touchpad. The keyboard feels nice and easy to type on. The screen looks nice. It runs completely quiet when doing basic tasks. Ramp it up and you can barely hear it. It also runs very cool vs all other laptop that runs hot. However, there are lots of improvements to be made to make this the perfect 15 inch laptop. The battery life doesn't last as long as the 12hr claim. It only lasts me about 5 hours of light use with screen brightness on at 80% which is very disappointing. The screen is not that bright even though it is an IPS panel and it has some small light bleed around the edge when sitting in a perfect dark room. It seems this light bleed issue affect all laptop and desktop monitors out there, except smartphones screen. We want brighter screen. There are still some bezel to trim off further and we want complete bezeless display. The touchpad needs to be smaller and centered with the space bar so users don't accidentally touch it when typing which can screw up the typing process. Most laptop manufacturers weren't even aware of this issue, I'm looking at you engineer and designer. We seriously need a fingerprint reader for the laptop and a backlit keyboard! I can't see the keys sitting in the dark. We also need a standard SD card slot, not a MicroSD. We can't insert a standard SD card into a MicroSD slot, jeeze. What were you thinking Samsung? The webcam is mediocre which has bad quality video. Get rid of it if you can't improve it. If you can move the speakers to the top because the sound will be blocked if I set it on the bed. We also want faster performance as the current performance is not fast enough. Please fix and improve on these reported problem on your next model Samsung. I will be happy to upgrade if you will. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT (2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review
