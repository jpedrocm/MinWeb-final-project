I am not computer science or engineering major so there has never really been the need for me to have a whole lot of laptop in my backpack. Although, sluggish performance is something I don't need either and my previous budget laptop was just not making the cut. So over the summer I have been on the hunt for the right budget-friendly computer to suit my minimal needs for web browsing, video streaming, and word processing. In the beginning of July I found this baby and I was immediately convinced it would be my next laptop for school. It has triple the performance and RAM at practically the same price as my previous laptop. Also, it's part of the ThinkPad series so I could already imagine it could take a beating. Upon receiving the laptop in the mail I was even more impressed. The ThinkPad 11e comes with enough heft and weight to feel like a very well-built laptop. Keyboard had very tactile and clicky buttons that made me feel I didn't need to be gentle when it comes time to crunching out papers. Performance wise, this device is quick! It boots in seconds and can handle a great amount of tabs on Chrome along with opened apps, like Word, before you start noticing a difference on those 8GB of RAM. What I, personally, love is that the computer comes with barely any bloatware so it doesn't take a toll on the 128 GB SSD storage. Battery life is astounding and can definitely last a full afternoon and longer if you manage the performance and tweak the brightness. Added bonuses that I noticed with the device is its ability to reach a full charge in a little over an hour from 10% which is amazing if I forget to charge the thing the night before. Also, the speakers on this device get loud! I have never found myself cranking this thing above 50% because I don't feel the need to let others know in the other room what I am listening to. Lastly, the inclusion of an ethernet port is just perfect which I really didn't expect from a small scale computer. Overall, this laptop has no flashy features but it does what it can do exceptionally well. I would definitely recommend this device to the college student or anyone who needs a portable laptop with some quickness. Date published: 2016-08-08 Rated 4 out of 5 by Phaul22 from One of the best options for students!! I've owned this laptops for about 2 months now and it works great!! I configured mine with a Core i3 Processor (for extra power) and although the resolution is a measly 1366 x 768, it works well with the laptops small screen and form factor. This is one of the best laptops for students and is very inexpensive!!! Date published: 2016-06-02 Rated 2 out of 5 by Ceecee from Very portable but performs poorly It's certainly an improvement over my previous 7 year old laptop but it does not run as smoothly as it should for a brand new device. Some pages take long to load or, like right now, I can type faster than it takes for the text to show up. I've also tried several browsers and they each freeze when going to certain intensive websites. It's a shame because I only really need it to browse websites while hanging out. The biggest pro is that it is super light weight so I can take it everywhere easily.

Asked by: Michael45 The unit does not have a built in optical drive, however, when you need access to an optical drive you could always use an external USB optical drive. Lenovo has an external USB optical available in the accessories section of the website. Answered by: SalesRep Date published: 2016-10-16 I am comparing Thinkpad 13 with Thinkpad 11e. Would I get any performance advantage of one over the other? My Usage: MsWORD. MsExcel. Email. Amazon & Shopping. Facebook. Pdf. Jpeg. I Never game. Never Stream. Never skype. Asked by: Simpson Sherryway If you pick the slowest processor option in both cases, the 13 is quite a bit faster. You can upgrade the processor on both -- the fastest processor option on the 11e (the I3 6100U) is the slowest processor option on the 13. But it looks to me like the fastest processor on the 13 isn't all that much quicker (I5 6300U). You can compare them at cpuboss.com. The obvious big differences are the screen size and the fact that the 11e is ruggedized (harder to break). I bought the 11e for my teenager who is rather abusive to his stuff. Looks like they both come with SSDs which to me is more important that processor speed. Answered by: mtgun Date published: 2016-08-30 Does this have touch screen capability? Asked by: Mona123 No. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-08-18 W700 Questions - page 2 2016-10-16T08:36CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvqa, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasquestionsanswers, tq_5 loc_en_US, sid_8AE5D3ABA41655BC06E281B8EA00B140_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_helpfulnessAnswersFirst clientName_Lenovo compare products ?

I am not computer science or engineering major so there has never really been the need for me to have a whole lot of laptop in my backpack. Although, sluggish performance is something I don't need either and my previous budget laptop was just not making the cut. So over the summer I have been on the hunt for the right budget-friendly computer to suit my minimal needs for web browsing, video streaming, and word processing. In the beginning of July I found this baby and I was immediately convinced it would be my next laptop for school. It has triple the performance and RAM at practically the same price as my previous laptop. Also, it's part of the ThinkPad series so I could already imagine it could take a beating. Upon receiving the laptop in the mail I was even more impressed. The ThinkPad 11e comes with enough heft and weight to feel like a very well-built laptop. Keyboard had very tactile and clicky buttons that made me feel I didn't need to be gentle when it comes time to crunching out papers. Performance wise, this device is quick! It boots in seconds and can handle a great amount of tabs on Chrome along with opened apps, like Word, before you start noticing a difference on those 8GB of RAM. What I, personally, love is that the computer comes with barely any bloatware so it doesn't take a toll on the 128 GB SSD storage. Battery life is astounding and can definitely last a full afternoon and longer if you manage the performance and tweak the brightness. Added bonuses that I noticed with the device is its ability to reach a full charge in a little over an hour from 10% which is amazing if I forget to charge the thing the night before. Also, the speakers on this device get loud! I have never found myself cranking this thing above 50% because I don't feel the need to let others know in the other room what I am listening to. Lastly, the inclusion of an ethernet port is just perfect which I really didn't expect from a small scale computer. Overall, this laptop has no flashy features but it does what it can do exceptionally well. I would definitely recommend this device to the college student or anyone who needs a portable laptop with some quickness. Date published: 2016-08-08 Rated 4 out of 5 by Phaul22 from One of the best options for students!! I've owned this laptops for about 2 months now and it works great!! I configured mine with a Core i3 Processor (for extra power) and although the resolution is a measly 1366 x 768, it works well with the laptops small screen and form factor. This is one of the best laptops for students and is very inexpensive!!! Date published: 2016-06-02 Rated 2 out of 5 by Ceecee from Very portable but performs poorly It's certainly an improvement over my previous 7 year old laptop but it does not run as smoothly as it should for a brand new device. Some pages take long to load or, like right now, I can type faster than it takes for the text to show up. I've also tried several browsers and they each freeze when going to certain intensive websites. It's a shame because I only really need it to browse websites while hanging out. The biggest pro is that it is super light weight so I can take it everywhere easily.

Asked by: Michael45 The unit does not have a built in optical drive, however, when you need access to an optical drive you could always use an external USB optical drive. Lenovo has an external USB optical available in the accessories section of the website. Answered by: SalesRep Date published: 2016-10-16 I am comparing Thinkpad 13 with Thinkpad 11e. Would I get any performance advantage of one over the other? My Usage: MsWORD. MsExcel. Email. Amazon & Shopping. Facebook. Pdf. Jpeg. I Never game. Never Stream. Never skype. Asked by: Simpson Sherryway If you pick the slowest processor option in both cases, the 13 is quite a bit faster. You can upgrade the processor on both -- the fastest processor option on the 11e (the I3 6100U) is the slowest processor option on the 13. But it looks to me like the fastest processor on the 13 isn't all that much quicker (I5 6300U). You can compare them at cpuboss.com. The obvious big differences are the screen size and the fact that the 11e is ruggedized (harder to break). I bought the 11e for my teenager who is rather abusive to his stuff. Looks like they both come with SSDs which to me is more important that processor speed. Answered by: mtgun Date published: 2016-08-30 Does this have touch screen capability? Asked by: Mona123 No. Answered by: Lenovo Date published: 2016-08-18 W700 Questions - page 2 2016-10-16T08:36CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvqa, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasquestionsanswers, tq_5 loc_en_US, sid_8AE5D3ABA41655BC06E281B8EA00B140_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_helpfulnessAnswersFirst clientName_Lenovo compare products

Rated 5 out of 5 by ert1013 from High-end Laptop at a Budget Laptop Price Being a college student, I have had my fair share of budget laptops over the years. I am not computer science or engineering major so there has never really been the need for me to have a whole lot of laptop in my backpack. Although, sluggish performance is something I don't need either and my previous budget laptop was just not making the cut. So over the summer I have been on the hunt for the right budget-friendly computer to suit my minimal needs for web browsing, video streaming, and word processing. In the beginning of July I found this baby and I was immediately convinced it would be my next laptop for school. It has triple the performance and RAM at practically the same price as my previous laptop. Also, it's part of the ThinkPad series so I could already imagine it could take a beating. Upon receiving the laptop in the mail I was even more impressed. The ThinkPad 11e comes with enough heft and weight to feel like a very well-built laptop. Keyboard had very tactile and clicky buttons that made me feel I didn't need to be gentle when it comes time to crunching out papers. Performance wise, this device is quick! It boots in seconds and can handle a great amount of tabs on Chrome along with opened apps, like Word, before you start noticing a difference on those 8GB of RAM. What I, personally, love is that the computer comes with barely any bloatware so it doesn't take a toll on the 128 GB SSD storage. Battery life is astounding and can definitely last a full afternoon and longer if you manage the performance and tweak the brightness. Added bonuses that I noticed with the device is its ability to reach a full charge in a little over an hour from 10% which is amazing if I forget to charge the thing the night before. Also, the speakers on this device get loud! I have never found myself cranking this thing above 50% because I don't feel the need to let others know in the other room what I am listening to. Lastly, the inclusion of an ethernet port is just perfect which I really didn't expect from a small scale computer. Overall, this laptop has no flashy features but it does what it can do exceptionally well. I would definitely recommend this device to the college student or anyone who needs a portable laptop with some quickness. Date published: 2016-08-08 Rated 4 out of 5 by Phaul22 from One of the best options for students!! I've owned this laptops for about 2 months now and it works great!! I configured mine with a Core i3 Processor (for extra power) and although the resolution is a measly 1366 x 768, it works well with the laptops small screen and form factor. This is one of the best laptops for students and is very inexpensive!!! Date published: 2016-06-02 Rated 2 out of 5 by Ceecee from Very portable but performs poorly It's certainly an improvement over my previous 7 year old laptop but it does not run as smoothly as it should for a brand new device. Some pages take long to load or, like right now, I can type faster than it takes for the text to show up. I've also tried several browsers and they each freeze when going to certain intensive websites. It's a shame because I only really need it to browse websites while hanging out. The biggest pro is that it is super light weight so I can take it everywhere easily.

Does this computer have a cd/dvd drive and ability to burn audio/video? Asked by: Michael45 The unit does not have a built in optical drive, however, when you need access to an optical drive you could always use an external USB optical drive. Lenovo has an external USB optical available in the accessories section of the website. Answered by: SalesRep Date published: 2016-10-16 I am comparing Thinkpad 13 with Thinkpad 11e. Would I get any performance advantage of one over the other? My Usage: MsWORD. MsExcel. Email. Amazon & Shopping. Facebook. Pdf. Jpeg. I Never game. Never Stream. Never skype. Asked by: Simpson Sherryway If you pick the slowest processor option in both cases, the 13 is quite a bit faster. You can upgrade the processor on both -- the fastest processor option on the 11e (the I3 6100U) is the slowest processor option on the 13. But it looks to me like the fastest processor on the 13 isn't all that much quicker (I5 6300U). You can compare them at cpuboss.com. The obvious big differences are the screen size and the fact that the 11e is ruggedized (harder to break). I bought the 11e for my teenager who is rather abusive to his stuff. Looks like they both come with SSDs which to me is more important that processor speed. Answered by: mtgun Date published: 2016-08-30 Does this have touch screen capability?
