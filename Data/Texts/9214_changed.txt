Previously I was using Carbon X1 but after changing to Yoga X1 I get better batery life up to 11 h plus more features as SIM slot and different positions of the display. I'm able now to use the laptop as tablet. Great choose and I will recommend to everybody Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 2 out of 5 by x1medstudent from Amazing? ... um actually I wish it was, but no. Issues: Does not resume from sleep mode, it beeps 4 times pause x3. Flipping screen from tablet to laptop mode, display still thinks its in tablet mode. Battery says its going to last usually 6 hours instead of the advertised 9, with just internet browsing. I called tech support, all Bios and Drivers updated, not fixed. Will send into Lenovo Depot. With this price, Lenovo needs to do a better quality control of their products. This is my third X1, I've owned two non-yoga 2015 X1 prior to this purchase, I had to send both defective X1's back. I'm hoping they fix my expensive laptop. Date published: 2016-02-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by Doctor Charlie from Amazing Computer for my clinic! I love my Thinkpad X230 but it's more than 3 years old and it's showing its age although it still works perfectly fine. I used my computer for work almost 24/7. I upgraded to Thinkpad X1 Yoga with Windows 10 Pro i7 processor, and it's just amazingly fast and responsive, the touchscreen with pen is just perfect, Bluetooth is very useful for dictation. I still can't decide if it's really a laptop or a tablet and either one does the job to my satisfaction. Its thin and light. It's worth the hefty price. Lenovo computers are indeed the leader for business computers!

If so, that is a deal breaker for me. I was waiting for the 14-inch ThinkPad Yoga Gen 2 to finally be released as promised from CES '15 to no avail... Why does Lenovo keep killing ThinkPad dGPU?

It doesn't seem like it... Asked by: bob_c Yes, the keyboard on the X1 Yoga is lift and lock. Answered by: Lenovo Staff Date published: 2016-01-09 Why does the engineering team opted to not using DDR4 but still sticking to DDR3? That sounds a deal breaker! Asked by: ChrisC4 DDR4 is not the "be all, end all" yet. No, it's not even close to crushing DDR3 to warrant any manufacturers, vendors, etc to move towards DDR4. The performance improvement has to take into two factors: CAS latency and clock cycles. It's "true latency" is a combination of both, and theoretically as well as realistically. Below is an example of running a performance analysis of DDR3 and DDR4 using the same CPU. Reference: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-review-6700k-6600k-ddr4-ddr3-ipc-6th-generation/7 Granted, critics as myself with my Computer Engineering background can say that the bottleneck may be the CPU, but the realist in is reminding myself that as you commit yourself with a particular CPU, you are not like [aka NEVER] going to change your CPU just because you upgrade your memory from DDR3 to DDR4. Having my $0.02 said, here are some realistic numbers: (1) The performance improvement of DDR4 compared to DDR3 is in the single digits. Looking at the graphs, < 2% improvement. (in the URL above, if allowed to be shown) (2) Price increase of DDR4 compared to DDR3 is in the double digits. It's at least 10% price increase. (research yourself) With those two statements above in mind, would you pay more for an insignificant performance increase?? I would not break my bank for a single digit performance increase. Does having DDR3 sound like a deal breaker now?

Previously I was using Carbon X1 but after changing to Yoga X1 I get better batery life up to 11 h plus more features as SIM slot and different positions of the display. I'm able now to use the laptop as tablet. Great choose and I will recommend to everybody Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 2 out of 5 by x1medstudent from Amazing? ... um actually I wish it was, but no. Issues: Does not resume from sleep mode, it beeps 4 times pause x3. Flipping screen from tablet to laptop mode, display still thinks its in tablet mode. Battery says its going to last usually 6 hours instead of the advertised 9, with just internet browsing. I called tech support, all Bios and Drivers updated, not fixed. Will send into Lenovo Depot. With this price, Lenovo needs to do a better quality control of their products. This is my third X1, I've owned two non-yoga 2015 X1 prior to this purchase, I had to send both defective X1's back. I'm hoping they fix my expensive laptop. Date published: 2016-02-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by Doctor Charlie from Amazing Computer for my clinic! I love my Thinkpad X230 but it's more than 3 years old and it's showing its age although it still works perfectly fine. I used my computer for work almost 24/7. I upgraded to Thinkpad X1 Yoga with Windows 10 Pro i7 processor, and it's just amazingly fast and responsive, the touchscreen with pen is just perfect, Bluetooth is very useful for dictation. I still can't decide if it's really a laptop or a tablet and either one does the job to my satisfaction. Its thin and light. It's worth the hefty price. Lenovo computers are indeed the leader for business computers!

If so, that is a deal breaker for me. I was waiting for the 14-inch ThinkPad Yoga Gen 2 to finally be released as promised from CES '15 to no avail... Why does Lenovo keep killing ThinkPad dGPU? First T series, now only P/W workstations are left Asked by: 15yrsLoyal Check the betbuy exclusive thinkpad yoga 14 its 8gb ram with 2gb dgpu nvidea graphics and it comes with the active pen like this one 256 gb ssd and its only 900 Answered by: smrtguy123 Date published: 2016-03-03 Does this have the lift and lock keyboard? It doesn't seem like it... Asked by: bob_c Yes, the keyboard on the X1 Yoga is lift and lock. Answered by: Lenovo Staff Date published: 2016-01-09 Why does the engineering team opted to not using DDR4 but still sticking to DDR3? That sounds a deal breaker! Asked by: ChrisC4 DDR4 is not the "be all, end all" yet. No, it's not even close to crushing DDR3 to warrant any manufacturers, vendors, etc to move towards DDR4. The performance improvement has to take into two factors: CAS latency and clock cycles. It's "true latency" is a combination of both, and theoretically as well as realistically. Below is an example of running a performance analysis of DDR3 and DDR4 using the same CPU. Reference: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-review-6700k-6600k-ddr4-ddr3-ipc-6th-generation/7 Granted, critics as myself with my Computer Engineering background can say that the bottleneck may be the CPU, but the realist in is reminding myself that as you commit yourself with a particular CPU, you are not like [aka NEVER] going to change your CPU just because you upgrade your memory from DDR3 to DDR4. Having my $0.02 said, here are some realistic numbers: (1) The performance improvement of DDR4 compared to DDR3 is in the single digits. Looking at the graphs, < 2% improvement. (in the URL above, if allowed to be shown) (2) Price increase of DDR4 compared to DDR3 is in the double digits. It's at least 10% price increase. (research yourself) With those two statements above in mind, would you pay more for an insignificant performance increase?? I would not break my bank for a single digit performance increase. Does having DDR3 sound like a deal breaker now?

Features ThinkPad X1 YogaFeatures Works the Way You Do Thin and light 14" 2-in-1 convertible, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga supports four flexible usage modes for when you want to work, present, create, and connect. Durable, Yet Ultrathin & Ultralight The full-sized, backlit keyboard is spill-resistant and the keys retract automatically when not being used as a laptop, so they are not exposed when the keyboard is face-down on a desk or table. Plus, the X1 Yoga is tested against military specifications and made to endure extremes. Yet for all its durability, it weighs just 2.8 lbs / 1.27 kg, making it the world's thinnest and lightest 14" 2-in-1 business laptop. Like the rest of the X1 family, this convertible Ultrabook™ is thin, light, and tough. ThinkPad X1 Yoga Works the Way You Do Stunning Display The thin X1 Yoga features a 14" 2K (2560 x 1440) touch screen display, with optional OLED technology. Richer Colors, Sharper Contrast These self-lighting pixels render a wider range of highly accurate colors, so your work, video, photos, and web pages look better than ever with richer colors and sharper contrast. X1 Yoga Features a Stunning 2K Display Be Creative The X1 Yoga lightweight 2-in-1 laptop includes a dockable stylus pen that recharges when connected—just 15 seconds of charging gives up to 100 minutes of use. And because it docks into the laptop, you can keep it handy for when you need it for drawing, annotating documents, or making notes. Handwriting Made Easy With Lenovo's exclusive WRITEit technology, you can enter handwriting into any input field across hundreds of apps, and it automatically suggests and corrects your writing. Use the Stylus Pen to Draw, Annotate, or Take Notes Powerful Performance The new lightweight X1 Yoga features a Windows 10 Pro operating system and up to 6th generation Intel® 7-6600U with vPro—that means lots of manageability features and enhanced security. Ultrafast Storage Options With ultrafast Samsung PCIe NVMe SSD storage, you can open files and applications more than two times faster than SATA SSD* * Results represent the overall performance in the Storage Access test, which evaluates storage read / write performance in 10 applications. PCIe NVME SSD is an optional configuration. Products can also be configured with regular PCIe SSD or SATA SSD. Ultrafast PCIe Storage Options Available Connect Anywhere, Anytime?Unplugged With optional LTE-A, you get the fastest, most advanced mobile broadband technology. And you can boost your productivity with the optional WiGig Dock (only available with 2K display), which lets you connect wirelessly for dual displays, audio devices, and more. With the X1 Yoga, you can stay connected yet go unplugged all day, and then some, as the battery lasts up to 11 hours*. * Based on testing three different product configurations with MobileMark 2014.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Aleksmkd from Yoga X1 One of the best laptops that I have. Previously I was using Carbon X1 but after changing to Yoga X1 I get better batery life up to 11 h plus more features as SIM slot and different positions of the display. I'm able now to use the laptop as tablet. Great choose and I will recommend to everybody Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 2 out of 5 by x1medstudent from Amazing? ... um actually I wish it was, but no. Issues: Does not resume from sleep mode, it beeps 4 times pause x3. Flipping screen from tablet to laptop mode, display still thinks its in tablet mode. Battery says its going to last usually 6 hours instead of the advertised 9, with just internet browsing. I called tech support, all Bios and Drivers updated, not fixed. Will send into Lenovo Depot. With this price, Lenovo needs to do a better quality control of their products. This is my third X1, I've owned two non-yoga 2015 X1 prior to this purchase, I had to send both defective X1's back. I'm hoping they fix my expensive laptop. Date published: 2016-02-09 Rated 5 out of 5 by Doctor Charlie from Amazing Computer for my clinic! I love my Thinkpad X230 but it's more than 3 years old and it's showing its age although it still works perfectly fine. I used my computer for work almost 24/7. I upgraded to Thinkpad X1 Yoga with Windows 10 Pro i7 processor, and it's just amazingly fast and responsive, the touchscreen with pen is just perfect, Bluetooth is very useful for dictation. I still can't decide if it's really a laptop or a tablet and either one does the job to my satisfaction. Its thin and light. It's worth the hefty price. Lenovo computers are indeed the leader for business computers!

No dGPU? If so, that is a deal breaker for me. I was waiting for the 14-inch ThinkPad Yoga Gen 2 to finally be released as promised from CES '15 to no avail... Why does Lenovo keep killing ThinkPad dGPU? First T series, now only P/W workstations are left Asked by: 15yrsLoyal Check the betbuy exclusive thinkpad yoga 14 its 8gb ram with 2gb dgpu nvidea graphics and it comes with the active pen like this one 256 gb ssd and its only 900 Answered by: smrtguy123 Date published: 2016-03-03 Does this have the lift and lock keyboard? It doesn't seem like it... Asked by: bob_c Yes, the keyboard on the X1 Yoga is lift and lock. Answered by: Lenovo Staff Date published: 2016-01-09 Why does the engineering team opted to not using DDR4 but still sticking to DDR3? That sounds a deal breaker! Asked by: ChrisC4 DDR4 is not the "be all, end all" yet. No, it's not even close to crushing DDR3 to warrant any manufacturers, vendors, etc to move towards DDR4. The performance improvement has to take into two factors: CAS latency and clock cycles. It's "true latency" is a combination of both, and theoretically as well as realistically. Below is an example of running a performance analysis of DDR3 and DDR4 using the same CPU. Reference: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-review-6700k-6600k-ddr4-ddr3-ipc-6th-generation/7 Granted, critics as myself with my Computer Engineering background can say that the bottleneck may be the CPU, but the realist in is reminding myself that as you commit yourself with a particular CPU, you are not like [aka NEVER] going to change your CPU just because you upgrade your memory from DDR3 to DDR4. Having my $0.02 said, here are some realistic numbers: (1) The performance improvement of DDR4 compared to DDR3 is in the single digits. Looking at the graphs, < 2% improvement. (in the URL above, if allowed to be shown) (2) Price increase of DDR4 compared to DDR3 is in the double digits. It's at least 10% price increase. (research yourself) With those two statements above in mind, would you pay more for an insignificant performance increase?? I would not break my bank for a single digit performance increase. Does having DDR3 sound like a deal breaker now?
