For what the 11e has, it does well. The keyboard is solid, the display gets very bright, the parts are reliable, it charges very fast (roughly 90 minutes, although I just ordered a more powerful charger) and lasts a good amount (5-8 hours of screen-on time). I can do light streaming with this for websites (like PCPP). The speakers are decent, but on the quiet side. The microphone is competent for basic hangouts calls, although I usually plug in my own microphone. The RAM and hard drive can be upgraded because it uses (to my surprise) not soldered RAM but a single DDR3L SO-DIMM slot and a 2.5" SSD, not mSATA or m.2. I plan on putting 8GB of RAM and my old Intel 180GB SSD (330 series) in here and running Windows on it when I graduate school (there is a signed contract that to use the Chromebooks, it is forbidden to modify any hardware or software (so I could dual boot it but not remove ChromeOS). However, it is missing some features that are important to me, even for a lower-end laptop. One instance is an ethernet port. On the Chromebook variant (which I have), the ethernet port was removed and sealed off. There is still a spot for it to be added, but it isn't there! I use ethernet so often for wired LAN or a VPN to my home PC to do gaming at other people's houses, but it is very hard now with only Wi-Fi, because the connection is unparalleled when compared to ethernet. The top section (between the keyboard and the hinges) shows a beating, even when handled with decent care for a nerd like myself (more than enough scuff marks and some frame cracks from a drop inside a backpack less than a foot off the ground, and yes there was padding). The search button should have been made an F key and CAPS LOCK as is. To change to a Dvorak keyboard in the software is easy in 10 seconds, but I cannot change around the keys on the keyboard. There is no key backlight, so when I am trying to program when I am supposed to be sleeping, seeing the keys is not an easy task (I suppose I should just listen to my parents then...lol). The trackpad's click can feel weird sometimes, like a double click on release. The camera is a grainy 720p camera that feels like a 360p camera. I can get by with the backlight, camera, trackpad, and key caps, but the ethernet port and durability in certain spots were big bummers for me. Overall, as a Chromebook for school/personal hybrid, I think it works well, but my demands are beyond this machine. Date published: 2016-08-13 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lorna from Stay away! I have been a fan of Lenovo for years but not now. I bought this several months ago and it has been a disaster. I don't use it for work but just for internet cruising. The display driver crashes, I constantly get the blue screen of death and a lot of other issues. I have followed instructions to update drivers. I have reset to factory settings twice, but to no avail.

For what the 11e has, it does well. The keyboard is solid, the display gets very bright, the parts are reliable, it charges very fast (roughly 90 minutes, although I just ordered a more powerful charger) and lasts a good amount (5-8 hours of screen-on time). I can do light streaming with this for websites (like PCPP). The speakers are decent, but on the quiet side. The microphone is competent for basic hangouts calls, although I usually plug in my own microphone. The RAM and hard drive can be upgraded because it uses (to my surprise) not soldered RAM but a single DDR3L SO-DIMM slot and a 2.5" SSD, not mSATA or m.2. I plan on putting 8GB of RAM and my old Intel 180GB SSD (330 series) in here and running Windows on it when I graduate school (there is a signed contract that to use the Chromebooks, it is forbidden to modify any hardware or software (so I could dual boot it but not remove ChromeOS). However, it is missing some features that are important to me, even for a lower-end laptop. One instance is an ethernet port. On the Chromebook variant (which I have), the ethernet port was removed and sealed off. There is still a spot for it to be added, but it isn't there! I use ethernet so often for wired LAN or a VPN to my home PC to do gaming at other people's houses, but it is very hard now with only Wi-Fi, because the connection is unparalleled when compared to ethernet. The top section (between the keyboard and the hinges) shows a beating, even when handled with decent care for a nerd like myself (more than enough scuff marks and some frame cracks from a drop inside a backpack less than a foot off the ground, and yes there was padding). The search button should have been made an F key and CAPS LOCK as is. To change to a Dvorak keyboard in the software is easy in 10 seconds, but I cannot change around the keys on the keyboard. There is no key backlight, so when I am trying to program when I am supposed to be sleeping, seeing the keys is not an easy task (I suppose I should just listen to my parents then...lol). The trackpad's click can feel weird sometimes, like a double click on release. The camera is a grainy 720p camera that feels like a 360p camera. I can get by with the backlight, camera, trackpad, and key caps, but the ethernet port and durability in certain spots were big bummers for me. Overall, as a Chromebook for school/personal hybrid, I think it works well, but my demands are beyond this machine. Date published: 2016-08-13 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lorna from Stay away! I have been a fan of Lenovo for years but not now. I bought this several months ago and it has been a disaster. I don't use it for work but just for internet cruising. The display driver crashes, I constantly get the blue screen of death and a lot of other issues. I have followed instructions to update drivers. I have reset to factory settings twice, but to no avail.

Rated 4 out of 5 by NJFilm from Does what it has well. For what the 11e has, it does well. The keyboard is solid, the display gets very bright, the parts are reliable, it charges very fast (roughly 90 minutes, although I just ordered a more powerful charger) and lasts a good amount (5-8 hours of screen-on time). I can do light streaming with this for websites (like PCPP). The speakers are decent, but on the quiet side. The microphone is competent for basic hangouts calls, although I usually plug in my own microphone. The RAM and hard drive can be upgraded because it uses (to my surprise) not soldered RAM but a single DDR3L SO-DIMM slot and a 2.5" SSD, not mSATA or m.2. I plan on putting 8GB of RAM and my old Intel 180GB SSD (330 series) in here and running Windows on it when I graduate school (there is a signed contract that to use the Chromebooks, it is forbidden to modify any hardware or software (so I could dual boot it but not remove ChromeOS). However, it is missing some features that are important to me, even for a lower-end laptop. One instance is an ethernet port. On the Chromebook variant (which I have), the ethernet port was removed and sealed off. There is still a spot for it to be added, but it isn't there! I use ethernet so often for wired LAN or a VPN to my home PC to do gaming at other people's houses, but it is very hard now with only Wi-Fi, because the connection is unparalleled when compared to ethernet. The top section (between the keyboard and the hinges) shows a beating, even when handled with decent care for a nerd like myself (more than enough scuff marks and some frame cracks from a drop inside a backpack less than a foot off the ground, and yes there was padding). The search button should have been made an F key and CAPS LOCK as is. To change to a Dvorak keyboard in the software is easy in 10 seconds, but I cannot change around the keys on the keyboard. There is no key backlight, so when I am trying to program when I am supposed to be sleeping, seeing the keys is not an easy task (I suppose I should just listen to my parents then...lol). The trackpad's click can feel weird sometimes, like a double click on release. The camera is a grainy 720p camera that feels like a 360p camera. I can get by with the backlight, camera, trackpad, and key caps, but the ethernet port and durability in certain spots were big bummers for me. Overall, as a Chromebook for school/personal hybrid, I think it works well, but my demands are beyond this machine. Date published: 2016-08-13 Rated 1 out of 5 by Lorna from Stay away! I have been a fan of Lenovo for years but not now. I bought this several months ago and it has been a disaster. I don't use it for work but just for internet cruising. The display driver crashes, I constantly get the blue screen of death and a lot of other issues. I have followed instructions to update drivers. I have reset to factory settings twice, but to no avail.
