Apple MacBook Air MJVG2LL/A 13.3-Inch Notebook Laptop 256GB Hard Drive + 4GB Memory - Newest Model Ships from United States. Most customers receive within 4-10 days. Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Features: - 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 (Broadwell) - 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM - 256GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage - Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 - 13.3" LED-Backlit Glossy Display - 1440 x 900 Native Resolution - 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 - USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2 - 720p FaceTime HD Camera, SDXC Card Slot - Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite The 13.3" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68" -- it tapers down to 0.11" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 256GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 13.3" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1440 x 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the "netbook" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. The MacBook Air comes with a complete suite of digital creativity applications. iMovie will help you edit your home movies, iPhoto will organize digital photos, and GarageBand allows you to compose original music. The Macbook Air also provides three apps to keep you productive. Pages allow you to make creative word documents. Numbers helps you make spreadsheets more visually insightful. Keynote allows you to create a powerful presentation, complete with animated charts, interactive tables with cinematic effects and transitions. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays. And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store. Because the software in the store is curated by Apple, you can be sure that it is free of malware and safe to use. And, like the iOS App Store, you'll automatically be notified when updated versions of your favorite programs are available for download. Design Thin, Light, Durable. Thank You, Flash Storage Flash storage helps make MacBook Air incredibly thin and light - under an inch and as little as 2.96 pounds. Flash storage uses solid state technology, meaning there are no moving parts. No moving parts means flash storage is more reliable, durable and quiet than traditional hard drives. And it takes up much less space than a traditional hard drive - about 90 percent less, in fact. That creates room for other important things, like a bigger battery. So you have a notebook that weighs almost nothing and runs all day long. Now that's mobility mastered The Best Way to Multi-Touch on a Notebook Multi-touch technology is an essential part of Apple products. It's an immersive way to interact with your devices. And the optimal way to experience Multi-Touch on a notebook is through a trackpad. That's precisely the case with MacBook Air. The trackpad's spacious, all-glass surface doesn't have a button because the whole thing is the button. And with multi-touch gestures in Mac OS X, you can interact with MacBook Air in ways that feel more intuitive and realistic than ever before See Your QWERTY in Lights Anyone can try to make a notebook that's thin and light, but success comes in doing it without cutting corners. That's why MacBook Air features a fully featured keyboard that's just as comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. And the keyboard is backlit, so you can type in low-light conditions with ease. A built-in sensor detects changes in the ambient lighting and adjusts the keyboard and display brightness automatically, giving you the perfect illumination in any environment A Battery That Can Get You Through the Day and the Month Thanks to smaller components such as flash storage, Apple is able to allocate space for a bigger battery. And when the goal is to design the perfect notebook for everyday use, giving priority to the battery just makes sense. With the MacBook Air, you'll get up to 12 hours of battery life for both web browsing and when watching iTunes movies. Put MacBook Air to sleep for more than 3 hours and it enters standby mode. That means you can come back to MacBook Air up to an entire month later and it wakes in an instant. Please note that battery life may vary depending on use A Thing of Beauty and Durability The MacBook Air features a unibody design for both the main enclosure and the display. Unibody construction means a higher-precision, less complex design with fewer parts. That translates to a notebook that's exceptionally thin and light, yet durable enough to handle the rigors of everyday use. In addition, MacBook Air offers innovations like the MagSafe 2 power connector, which breaks cleanly away from the notebook if you accidentally trip over the power cord.

Apple MacBook Air MJVG2LL/A 13.3-Inch Notebook Laptop 256GB Hard Drive + 4GB Memory - Newest Model Ships from United States. Most customers receive within 4-10 days. Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Features: - 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 (Broadwell) - 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM - 256GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage - Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 - 13.3" LED-Backlit Glossy Display - 1440 x 900 Native Resolution - 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 - USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2 - 720p FaceTime HD Camera, SDXC Card Slot - Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite The 13.3" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68" -- it tapers down to 0.11" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 256GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 13.3" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1440 x 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the "netbook" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. The MacBook Air comes with a complete suite of digital creativity applications. iMovie will help you edit your home movies, iPhoto will organize digital photos, and GarageBand allows you to compose original music. The Macbook Air also provides three apps to keep you productive. Pages allow you to make creative word documents. Numbers helps you make spreadsheets more visually insightful. Keynote allows you to create a powerful presentation, complete with animated charts, interactive tables with cinematic effects and transitions. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays. And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store. Because the software in the store is curated by Apple, you can be sure that it is free of malware and safe to use. And, like the iOS App Store, you'll automatically be notified when updated versions of your favorite programs are available for download. Design Thin, Light, Durable. Thank You, Flash Storage Flash storage helps make MacBook Air incredibly thin and light - under an inch and as little as 2.96 pounds. Flash storage uses solid state technology, meaning there are no moving parts. No moving parts means flash storage is more reliable, durable and quiet than traditional hard drives. And it takes up much less space than a traditional hard drive - about 90 percent less, in fact. That creates room for other important things, like a bigger battery. So you have a notebook that weighs almost nothing and runs all day long. Now that's mobility mastered The Best Way to Multi-Touch on a Notebook Multi-touch technology is an essential part of Apple products. It's an immersive way to interact with your devices. And the optimal way to experience Multi-Touch on a notebook is through a trackpad. That's precisely the case with MacBook Air. The trackpad's spacious, all-glass surface doesn't have a button because the whole thing is the button. And with multi-touch gestures in Mac OS X, you can interact with MacBook Air in ways that feel more intuitive and realistic than ever before See Your QWERTY in Lights Anyone can try to make a notebook that's thin and light, but success comes in doing it without cutting corners. That's why MacBook Air features a fully featured keyboard that's just as comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. And the keyboard is backlit, so you can type in low-light conditions with ease. A built-in sensor detects changes in the ambient lighting and adjusts the keyboard and display brightness automatically, giving you the perfect illumination in any environment A Battery That Can Get You Through the Day and the Month Thanks to smaller components such as flash storage, Apple is able to allocate space for a bigger battery. And when the goal is to design the perfect notebook for everyday use, giving priority to the battery just makes sense. With the MacBook Air, you'll get up to 12 hours of battery life for both web browsing and when watching iTunes movies. Put MacBook Air to sleep for more than 3 hours and it enters standby mode. That means you can come back to MacBook Air up to an entire month later and it wakes in an instant. Please note that battery life may vary depending on use A Thing of Beauty and Durability The MacBook Air features a unibody design for both the main enclosure and the display. Unibody construction means a higher-precision, less complex design with fewer parts. That translates to a notebook that's exceptionally thin and light, yet durable enough to handle the rigors of everyday use. In addition, MacBook Air offers innovations like the MagSafe 2 power connector, which breaks cleanly away from the notebook if you accidentally trip over the power cord.

Thank You, Flash Storage Flash storage helps make MacBook Air incredibly thin and light - under an inch and as little as 2.96 pounds. Flash storage uses solid state technology, meaning there are no moving parts. No moving parts means flash storage is more reliable, durable and quiet than traditional hard drives. And it takes up much less space than a traditional hard drive - about 90 percent less, in fact. That creates room for other important things, like a bigger battery. So you have a notebook that weighs almost nothing and runs all day long. Now that's mobility mastered The Best Way to Multi-Touch on a Notebook Multi-touch technology is an essential part of Apple products. It's an immersive way to interact with your devices. And the optimal way to experience Multi-Touch on a notebook is through a trackpad. That's precisely the case with MacBook Air. The trackpad's spacious, all-glass surface doesn't have a button because the whole thing is the button. And with multi-touch gestures in Mac OS X, you can interact with MacBook Air in ways that feel more intuitive and realistic than ever before See Your QWERTY in Lights Anyone can try to make a notebook that's thin and light, but success comes in doing it without cutting corners. That's why MacBook Air features a fully featured keyboard that's just as comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. And the keyboard is backlit, so you can type in low-light conditions with ease. A built-in sensor detects changes in the ambient lighting and adjusts the keyboard and display brightness automatically, giving you the perfect illumination in any environment A Battery That Can Get You Through the Day and the Month Thanks to smaller components such as flash storage, Apple is able to allocate space for a bigger battery. And when the goal is to design the perfect notebook for everyday use, giving priority to the battery just makes sense. With the MacBook Air, you'll get up to 12 hours of battery life for both web browsing and when watching iTunes movies. Put MacBook Air to sleep for more than 3 hours and it enters standby mode. That means you can come back to MacBook Air up to an entire month later and it wakes in an instant. Please note that battery life may vary depending on use A Thing of Beauty and Durability The MacBook Air features a unibody design for both the main enclosure and the display. Unibody construction means a higher-precision, less complex design with fewer parts. That translates to a notebook that's exceptionally thin and light, yet durable enough to handle the rigors of everyday use. In addition, MacBook Air offers innovations like the MagSafe 2 power connector, which breaks cleanly away from the notebook if you accidentally trip over the power cord.

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Features: - 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 (Broadwell) - 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM - 256GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage - Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 - 13.3" LED-Backlit Glossy Display - 1440 x 900 Native Resolution - 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 - USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2 - 720p FaceTime HD Camera, SDXC Card Slot - Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite The 13.3" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68" -- it tapers down to 0.11" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 256GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 13.3" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1440 x 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the "netbook" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. The MacBook Air comes with a complete suite of digital creativity applications. iMovie will help you edit your home movies, iPhoto will organize digital photos, and GarageBand allows you to compose original music. The Macbook Air also provides three apps to keep you productive. Pages allow you to make creative word documents. Numbers helps you make spreadsheets more visually insightful. Keynote allows you to create a powerful presentation, complete with animated charts, interactive tables with cinematic effects and transitions. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays. And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store.

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Features: - 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 (Broadwell) - 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM - 256GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage - Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 - 13.3" LED-Backlit Glossy Display - 1440 x 900 Native Resolution - 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 - USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2 - 720p FaceTime HD Camera, SDXC Card Slot - Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite The 13.3" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68" -- it tapers down to 0.11" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 256GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 13.3" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1440 x 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the "netbook" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. The MacBook Air comes with a complete suite of digital creativity applications. iMovie will help you edit your home movies, iPhoto will organize digital photos, and GarageBand allows you to compose original music. The Macbook Air also provides three apps to keep you productive. Pages allow you to make creative word documents. Numbers helps you make spreadsheets more visually insightful. Keynote allows you to create a powerful presentation, complete with animated charts, interactive tables with cinematic effects and transitions. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays. And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store. Because the software in the store is curated by Apple, you can be sure that it is free of malware and safe to use. And, like the iOS App Store, you'll automatically be notified when updated versions of your favorite programs are available for download. Design Thin, Light, Durable. Thank You, Flash Storage Flash storage helps make MacBook Air incredibly thin and light - under an inch and as little as 2.96 pounds. Flash storage uses solid state technology, meaning there are no moving parts. No moving parts means flash storage is more reliable, durable and quiet than traditional hard drives. And it takes up much less space than a traditional hard drive - about 90 percent less, in fact. That creates room for other important things, like a bigger battery. So you have a notebook that weighs almost nothing and runs all day long. Now that's mobility mastered The Best Way to Multi-Touch on a Notebook Multi-touch technology is an essential part of Apple products. It's an immersive way to interact with your devices. And the optimal way to experience Multi-Touch on a notebook is through a trackpad. That's precisely the case with MacBook Air. The trackpad's spacious, all-glass surface doesn't have a button because the whole thing is the button. And with multi-touch gestures in Mac OS X, you can interact with MacBook Air in ways that feel more intuitive and realistic than ever before See Your QWERTY in Lights Anyone can try to make a notebook that's thin and light, but success comes in doing it without cutting corners. That's why MacBook Air features a fully featured keyboard that's just as comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. And the keyboard is backlit, so you can type in low-light conditions with ease. A built-in sensor detects changes in the ambient lighting and adjusts the keyboard and display brightness automatically, giving you the perfect illumination in any environment A Battery That Can Get You Through the Day and the Month Thanks to smaller components such as flash storage, Apple is able to allocate space for a bigger battery. And when the goal is to design the perfect notebook for everyday use, giving priority to the battery just makes sense. With the MacBook Air, you'll get up to 12 hours of battery life for both web browsing and when watching iTunes movies. Put MacBook Air to sleep for more than 3 hours and it enters standby mode. That means you can come back to MacBook Air up to an entire month later and it wakes in an instant. Please note that battery life may vary depending on use A Thing of Beauty and Durability The MacBook Air features a unibody design for both the main enclosure and the display. Unibody construction means a higher-precision, less complex design with fewer parts. That translates to a notebook that's exceptionally thin and light, yet durable enough to handle the rigors of everyday use. In addition, MacBook Air offers innovations like the MagSafe 2 power connector, which breaks cleanly away from the notebook if you accidentally trip over the power cord.

Features: - 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 (Broadwell) - 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM - 256GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage - Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 - 13.3" LED-Backlit Glossy Display - 1440 x 900 Native Resolution - 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 - USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2 - 720p FaceTime HD Camera, SDXC Card Slot - Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite The 13.3" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68" -- it tapers down to 0.11" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 256GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 13.3" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1440 x 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the "netbook" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. The MacBook Air comes with a complete suite of digital creativity applications. iMovie will help you edit your home movies, iPhoto will organize digital photos, and GarageBand allows you to compose original music. The Macbook Air also provides three apps to keep you productive. Pages allow you to make creative word documents. Numbers helps you make spreadsheets more visually insightful. Keynote allows you to create a powerful presentation, complete with animated charts, interactive tables with cinematic effects and transitions. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays. And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store. Because the software in the store is curated by Apple, you can be sure that it is free of malware and safe to use. And, like the iOS App Store, you'll automatically be notified when updated versions of your favorite programs are available for download. Design Thin, Light, Durable. Thank You, Flash Storage Flash storage helps make MacBook Air incredibly thin and light - under an inch and as little as 2.96 pounds. Flash storage uses solid state technology, meaning there are no moving parts. No moving parts means flash storage is more reliable, durable and quiet than traditional hard drives. And it takes up much less space than a traditional hard drive - about 90 percent less, in fact. That creates room for other important things, like a bigger battery. So you have a notebook that weighs almost nothing and runs all day long. Now that's mobility mastered The Best Way to Multi-Touch on a Notebook Multi-touch technology is an essential part of Apple products. It's an immersive way to interact with your devices. And the optimal way to experience Multi-Touch on a notebook is through a trackpad. That's precisely the case with MacBook Air. The trackpad's spacious, all-glass surface doesn't have a button because the whole thing is the button. And with multi-touch gestures in Mac OS X, you can interact with MacBook Air in ways that feel more intuitive and realistic than ever before See Your QWERTY in Lights Anyone can try to make a notebook that's thin and light, but success comes in doing it without cutting corners. That's why MacBook Air features a fully featured keyboard that's just as comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. And the keyboard is backlit, so you can type in low-light conditions with ease. A built-in sensor detects changes in the ambient lighting and adjusts the keyboard and display brightness automatically, giving you the perfect illumination in any environment A Battery That Can Get You Through the Day and the Month Thanks to smaller components such as flash storage, Apple is able to allocate space for a bigger battery. And when the goal is to design the perfect notebook for everyday use, giving priority to the battery just makes sense. With the MacBook Air, you'll get up to 12 hours of battery life for both web browsing and when watching iTunes movies. Put MacBook Air to sleep for more than 3 hours and it enters standby mode. That means you can come back to MacBook Air up to an entire month later and it wakes in an instant. Please note that battery life may vary depending on use A Thing of Beauty and Durability The MacBook Air features a unibody design for both the main enclosure and the display. Unibody construction means a higher-precision, less complex design with fewer parts. That translates to a notebook that's exceptionally thin and light, yet durable enough to handle the rigors of everyday use. In addition, MacBook Air offers innovations like the MagSafe 2 power connector, which breaks cleanly away from the notebook if you accidentally trip over the power cord.
