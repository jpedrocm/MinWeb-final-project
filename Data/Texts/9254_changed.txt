It's was a solid machine when I purchased from IBM. Was a little worried about Lenovo but that quickly dissipated from my last purchase. I am so happy I chose the T560. It's a great machine, boots quickly and is a solid machine. Gripes? I have one. Because of the number pad is on the right, which I like, the touchpad and mouse (I disable the touchpad and use the red mouse pointer) are off center. When I am not docked sometimes my hand will fall off the end or try to move to the center. It's not that big of an issue but more of an annoyance. Other than that, it is a very fine laptop. Date published: 2016-07-08 Rated 1 out of 5 by wiley from Very heavy, CPU throttling and off-center trackpad I have a X1 carbon which is 2.6 pounds but I also wanted a 15 inch display laptop for productivity reasons. I wanted to buy lenovo because I have had great experience with their thinkpad X and T series in 14 inches. However this 15 inch laptop at 5.3 plus pounds weighs more than twice my X1 carbon. I wish there was a 15 inch version of the X1 carbon or a light thinkpad T560s which is similar to the thinkpad T460s (3 pounds). I like the 15 inch display, long battery life, key travel on the keyboard, the left and right click buttons on the trackpad. However the cpu throttling and the very heavy weight make it uncomfortable for everyday use. For 15 inch laptop, I would look elsewhere. Date published: 2016-04-26 Rated 5 out of 5 by Agrippa55 from Awesome Continuation of Best Laptop Brand Owned for one month and, once again, I believe I got me the best laptop ever. The deal was outstanding, chat folks helped every issue from price, to shipping, to purchased software installation. Everything is exactly what I expected and need. Nothing is better than a THINKPAD legacy product (gotta have the track-point); no bloatware; bluetooth/wireless combo is fast; SSD drive is fast; Windows 10 works perfect (much unlike upgraded systems); packaged MS Office and Adobe Acrobat are perfect; Battery life is unbelievable long (SSD helps); buy one. Awesome for PC heads.

It's was a solid machine when I purchased from IBM. Was a little worried about Lenovo but that quickly dissipated from my last purchase. I am so happy I chose the T560. It's a great machine, boots quickly and is a solid machine. Gripes? I have one. Because of the number pad is on the right, which I like, the touchpad and mouse (I disable the touchpad and use the red mouse pointer) are off center. When I am not docked sometimes my hand will fall off the end or try to move to the center. It's not that big of an issue but more of an annoyance. Other than that, it is a very fine laptop. Date published: 2016-07-08 Rated 1 out of 5 by wiley from Very heavy, CPU throttling and off-center trackpad I have a X1 carbon which is 2.6 pounds but I also wanted a 15 inch display laptop for productivity reasons. I wanted to buy lenovo because I have had great experience with their thinkpad X and T series in 14 inches. However this 15 inch laptop at 5.3 plus pounds weighs more than twice my X1 carbon. I wish there was a 15 inch version of the X1 carbon or a light thinkpad T560s which is similar to the thinkpad T460s (3 pounds). I like the 15 inch display, long battery life, key travel on the keyboard, the left and right click buttons on the trackpad. However the cpu throttling and the very heavy weight make it uncomfortable for everyday use. For 15 inch laptop, I would look elsewhere. Date published: 2016-04-26 Rated 5 out of 5 by Agrippa55 from Awesome Continuation of Best Laptop Brand Owned for one month and, once again, I believe I got me the best laptop ever. The deal was outstanding, chat folks helped every issue from price, to shipping, to purchased software installation. Everything is exactly what I expected and need. Nothing is better than a THINKPAD legacy product (gotta have the track-point); no bloatware; bluetooth/wireless combo is fast; SSD drive is fast; Windows 10 works perfect (much unlike upgraded systems); packaged MS Office and Adobe Acrobat are perfect; Battery life is unbelievable long (SSD helps); buy one. Awesome for PC heads.

What model you want recommend? Asked by: Fredricks It is depend of your goal - game (need good graphics) or modeling (need good processor speed ) Anatoli Answered by: Anat Date published: 2016-09-26 Does the Thinkpad t560 come standard with an Ethernet connection and can the battery be changed when it dies? Thanks Asked by: pete1 The answer to both is yes. Answered by: kimosabe Date published: 2016-09-07 how many USB ports are on the T560?

Rated 5 out of 5 by Diamond Cutter from Fantastic Machine and Lightweight I have been buying ThinkPads since the days of IBM. It's was a solid machine when I purchased from IBM. Was a little worried about Lenovo but that quickly dissipated from my last purchase. I am so happy I chose the T560. It's a great machine, boots quickly and is a solid machine. Gripes? I have one. Because of the number pad is on the right, which I like, the touchpad and mouse (I disable the touchpad and use the red mouse pointer) are off center. When I am not docked sometimes my hand will fall off the end or try to move to the center. It's not that big of an issue but more of an annoyance. Other than that, it is a very fine laptop. Date published: 2016-07-08 Rated 1 out of 5 by wiley from Very heavy, CPU throttling and off-center trackpad I have a X1 carbon which is 2.6 pounds but I also wanted a 15 inch display laptop for productivity reasons. I wanted to buy lenovo because I have had great experience with their thinkpad X and T series in 14 inches. However this 15 inch laptop at 5.3 plus pounds weighs more than twice my X1 carbon. I wish there was a 15 inch version of the X1 carbon or a light thinkpad T560s which is similar to the thinkpad T460s (3 pounds). I like the 15 inch display, long battery life, key travel on the keyboard, the left and right click buttons on the trackpad. However the cpu throttling and the very heavy weight make it uncomfortable for everyday use. For 15 inch laptop, I would look elsewhere. Date published: 2016-04-26 Rated 5 out of 5 by Agrippa55 from Awesome Continuation of Best Laptop Brand Owned for one month and, once again, I believe I got me the best laptop ever. The deal was outstanding, chat folks helped every issue from price, to shipping, to purchased software installation. Everything is exactly what I expected and need. Nothing is better than a THINKPAD legacy product (gotta have the track-point); no bloatware; bluetooth/wireless combo is fast; SSD drive is fast; Windows 10 works perfect (much unlike upgraded systems); packaged MS Office and Adobe Acrobat are perfect; Battery life is unbelievable long (SSD helps); buy one. Awesome for PC heads.

I wish there was a 15 inch version of the X1 carbon or a light thinkpad T560s which is similar to the thinkpad T460s (3 pounds). I like the 15 inch display, long battery life, key travel on the keyboard, the left and right click buttons on the trackpad. However the cpu throttling and the very heavy weight make it uncomfortable for everyday use. For 15 inch laptop, I would look elsewhere.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Agrippa55 from Awesome Continuation of Best Laptop Brand Owned for one month and, once again, I believe I got me the best laptop ever. The deal was outstanding, chat folks helped every issue from price, to shipping, to purchased software installation. Everything is exactly what I expected and need. Nothing is better than a THINKPAD legacy product (gotta have the track-point); no bloatware; bluetooth/wireless combo is fast; SSD drive is fast; Windows 10 works perfect (much unlike upgraded systems); packaged MS Office and Adobe Acrobat are perfect; Battery life is unbelievable long (SSD helps); buy one. Awesome for PC heads. Date published: 2016-05-26
