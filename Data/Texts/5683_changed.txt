Not all customers or software applications will necessarily benefit from use of this technology. Performance and clock frequency will vary depending on your application workload and hardware and software configurations. Intel's numbering is not a measurement of higher performance. Some functionality of this technology, such as Intel® Active management technology and Intel Virtualization technology, requires additional 3rd party software in order to run.  Availability of future "virtual appliances" applications for Intel vPro technology is dependent on 3rd party software providers. Sold as an optional feature. MIL-STD testing is pending and is not intended to demonstrate fitness for U.S. Department of Defense contract requirements or for military use. Test results are not a guarantee of future performance under these test conditions. Damage under the MIL STD test conditions or any accidental damage requires an optional HP Accidental Damage Protection Care Pack.
