According to ISO standards, in a good lighted room your screen brightness should be 80-90 cd/m2 to work with text, for working with color - 120 cd/m2; many people (those who wear sunglasses on a sunny day) turn their screens much darker - so save their precious eyes: I, for example, prefer around 50 cd/m2 in an office. Declared 220 cd/m2 would be enough for any kind of work in an office; you need more than that only if you work outside on a sunny day - but to feel really comfortable there, you will need brightness level around 500 - 800 cd/m2, which is not possible on any current notebooks. So unless you plan to work outside on a sunny day - ignore this screen brightness "specialist" and buy ThinkPad 13. Date published: 2016-04-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Elleneon from Perfect fit This is my first laptop, and I was forced to buy one by circumstances (work and school). I was looking for so long for some notebook that would fit me and I feel like this is the perfect choice. It has solid construction, no bs like convertibility or touch display, keyboard has nice touch, touchpad is responsive. Just nice and the basic configurations are pretty good value as well. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Donnalee from Nice weight and appearance. Adequate response time. Has dropped Wi-Fi a couple of times (updated driver). Could use at least 2 more 3.0 ports & a built in mike for Cortana & such. But overall this a very nice unit. Not really fond of Win-10. Liked my XP & Loved/love my Vista. Soon as I learn all the tweaks, I suppose it will grow on me. The tutorial is inadequate for 10. Downloaded a real, comprehensive tutorial--lots to learn. Included apps O.K. Store had more (free). Also, it doesn't seem to get hot. A big plus.

Asked by: ouiouiman Two slots for the RAM (Only DDR4. Max 16 GB from Lenovo, but upgradable to 32 GB yourself). SATA 6 Gbps M.2 is upgradable. WiFi module is upgradable. Answered by: Aske Date published: 2016-05-30 Does it have aluminium body? Asked by: zxsqw123 Only the lid for the silver version is aluminium, body is plastic. For the black one the whole unit is plastic. Answered by: gemmoglock Date published: 2016-05-04 How many hours of battery does this computer hold? Asked by: zvanbeever I fully charged it and then unplugged it and continued to use it as normal. I was watching Netflix the entire time, running several programs and a bunch of tabs, and played Candy Crush for a while, which usually uses a lot of battery power on my phone and presumably does on computers as well. I also had the brightness all the way up. It lasted about 5 hours. It would probably last longer with less intense usage!

According to ISO standards, in a good lighted room your screen brightness should be 80-90 cd/m2 to work with text, for working with color - 120 cd/m2; many people (those who wear sunglasses on a sunny day) turn their screens much darker - so save their precious eyes: I, for example, prefer around 50 cd/m2 in an office. Declared 220 cd/m2 would be enough for any kind of work in an office; you need more than that only if you work outside on a sunny day - but to feel really comfortable there, you will need brightness level around 500 - 800 cd/m2, which is not possible on any current notebooks. So unless you plan to work outside on a sunny day - ignore this screen brightness "specialist" and buy ThinkPad 13. Date published: 2016-04-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Elleneon from Perfect fit This is my first laptop, and I was forced to buy one by circumstances (work and school). I was looking for so long for some notebook that would fit me and I feel like this is the perfect choice. It has solid construction, no bs like convertibility or touch display, keyboard has nice touch, touchpad is responsive. Just nice and the basic configurations are pretty good value as well. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Donnalee from Nice weight and appearance. Adequate response time. Has dropped Wi-Fi a couple of times (updated driver). Could use at least 2 more 3.0 ports & a built in mike for Cortana & such. But overall this a very nice unit. Not really fond of Win-10. Liked my XP & Loved/love my Vista. Soon as I learn all the tweaks, I suppose it will grow on me. The tutorial is inadequate for 10. Downloaded a real, comprehensive tutorial--lots to learn. Included apps O.K. Store had more (free). Also, it doesn't seem to get hot. A big plus.

Asked by: ouiouiman Two slots for the RAM (Only DDR4. Max 16 GB from Lenovo, but upgradable to 32 GB yourself). SATA 6 Gbps M.2 is upgradable. WiFi module is upgradable. Answered by: Aske Date published: 2016-05-30 Does it have aluminium body? Asked by: zxsqw123 Only the lid for the silver version is aluminium, body is plastic. For the black one the whole unit is plastic. Answered by: gemmoglock Date published: 2016-05-04 How many hours of battery does this computer hold? Asked by: zvanbeever I fully charged it and then unplugged it and continued to use it as normal. I was watching Netflix the entire time, running several programs and a bunch of tabs, and played Candy Crush for a while, which usually uses a lot of battery power on my phone and presumably does on computers as well. I also had the brightness all the way up. It lasted about 5 hours. It would probably last longer with less intense usage!

Rated 4 out of 5 by FelixM from Screen is ok I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to respond to this abcd345 dude about screen brightness. According to ISO standards, in a good lighted room your screen brightness should be 80-90 cd/m2 to work with text, for working with color - 120 cd/m2; many people (those who wear sunglasses on a sunny day) turn their screens much darker - so save their precious eyes: I, for example, prefer around 50 cd/m2 in an office. Declared 220 cd/m2 would be enough for any kind of work in an office; you need more than that only if you work outside on a sunny day - but to feel really comfortable there, you will need brightness level around 500 - 800 cd/m2, which is not possible on any current notebooks. So unless you plan to work outside on a sunny day - ignore this screen brightness "specialist" and buy ThinkPad 13. Date published: 2016-04-11 Rated 5 out of 5 by Elleneon from Perfect fit This is my first laptop, and I was forced to buy one by circumstances (work and school). I was looking for so long for some notebook that would fit me and I feel like this is the perfect choice. It has solid construction, no bs like convertibility or touch display, keyboard has nice touch, touchpad is responsive. Just nice and the basic configurations are pretty good value as well. Date published: 2016-08-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Donnalee from Nice weight and appearance. Adequate response time. Has dropped Wi-Fi a couple of times (updated driver). Could use at least 2 more 3.0 ports & a built in mike for Cortana & such. But overall this a very nice unit. Not really fond of Win-10. Liked my XP & Loved/love my Vista. Soon as I learn all the tweaks, I suppose it will grow on me. The tutorial is inadequate for 10. Downloaded a real, comprehensive tutorial--lots to learn. Included apps O.K. Store had more (free). Also, it doesn't seem to get hot. A big plus.

To what extent is this machine upgradable? Asked by: ouiouiman Two slots for the RAM (Only DDR4. Max 16 GB from Lenovo, but upgradable to 32 GB yourself). SATA 6 Gbps M.2 is upgradable. WiFi module is upgradable. Answered by: Aske Date published: 2016-05-30 Does it have aluminium body? Asked by: zxsqw123 Only the lid for the silver version is aluminium, body is plastic. For the black one the whole unit is plastic. Answered by: gemmoglock Date published: 2016-05-04 How many hours of battery does this computer hold? Asked by: zvanbeever I fully charged it and then unplugged it and continued to use it as normal. I was watching Netflix the entire time, running several programs and a bunch of tabs, and played Candy Crush for a while, which usually uses a lot of battery power on my phone and presumably does on computers as well. I also had the brightness all the way up. It lasted about 5 hours. It would probably last longer with less intense usage!

How many hours of battery does this computer hold?
Asked by: zvanbeever
I fully charged it and then unplugged it and continued to use it as normal. I was watching Netflix the entire time, running several programs and a bunch of tabs, and played Candy Crush for a while, which usually uses a lot of battery power on my phone and presumably does on computers as well.
