Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A The Laptop TSAU21N3K isn't just another affordable laptop. It’s one that you can use in more than just one way. With a detachable keyboard, it lets you easily transform it from notebook to tablet to adapt to your needs. It combines powerful Intel processor with a bright 10.1” touchscreen and premium sound system, making it ideal for work and entertainment. Ultimate Flexibility Whether you’re working or watching video with friends, the Laptop TSAU21N3K has a mode for it. The integrated soft cover enables the screen to be set at any angle for perfect viewing. With a detachable keyboard, it transforms from a tablet to a laptop in a snap. When you're relying heavily on the keyboard – drafting documents or working on a spreadsheet, for example – keep it in the classic laptop mode for maximum productivity. But when you’re focusing on touch applications, web chatting, or enjoying a film or video, simply detach the keyboard to go in tablet mode. Performance You Can Count on Powered by Intel Atom Z3736F quad-core processor (1.33 GHz), 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB eMMC , the Laptop TSAU21N3K offers great speed and efficiency for responsive performance whether you're surfing the web, writing a paper or uploading photos. Brilliant 10.1-inch Touchscreen Designed for both productivity and HD entertainment, it's a dream to interact with. Big enough to share, bright enough to focus on, it's perfect for work and play. Great Sound The Laptop TSAU21N3K comes with built-in stereo speakers and employs HD Audio technology to deliver high quality sound for an immersive audio experience.
