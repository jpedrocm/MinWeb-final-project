In many ways, it is very similar to the T440s I replaced. It still has the great keyboard, the trackpad is better, it has a nice, non-reflective screen that looks and feels exactly the same, and it is very fast. However, this laptop is advertised as having "all day battery life". This is absolutely not true for my unit. I have gone through 9 charge cycles now, just typing and email, no videos or games, and the longest I ever got was about 4 hours. Typical are more 3-3.5 hours on one charge. Right now, I am on 31% with 56 minutes remaining. Date published: 2016-03-08 Rated 3 out of 5 by mattc from Battery life is severely lacking This is a great step in the right direction Lenovo - the screen and audio are great, the keyboard is what I'd expect from a modern lenovo, the build quality is sturdy, and the processor is snappy. Unfortunately the battery life is lacking. I'm lucky to get *3 hours* of unplugged time (at modest brightness under normal load) which is a far cry from the 10 hours touted. So, would I recommend this laptop? I wouldn't. I can only hope this machine represents an evolutionary step in Lenovo's design. It looks great. The size is fine. It just needs a significantly larger battery (think big here Lenovo - more is better). How about doubling or tripling what's inside? The fact that it's no longer using a hot swappable battery is fine so long as you can use that extra space to squeeze in more battery. Date published: 2016-03-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by DanielP from Workhorse with real power I've had this laptop for a month now, using it exclusively for all my computing, both personal and business, and it is outstanding. Under 10 seconds to boot, runs all my programs flawlessly, and the picture quality is so smooth and vibrant that I'm going to use it for Netfix too (I'm very picky about watching movies on computers - it has to look really good). If you're a touch typist, you will love the keyboard. The absolute best of any laptop I've tried. Good key travel and pressure for the right amount of feedback. I purchased this to replace another laptop and also a desktop, so I only have one computer moving forward. I'm extremely happy I made the choice of buying the T460s, as it has thus far served me well.

Can the battery ever be replaced if it begins to lose strength? Asked by: BobA2 Technically the battery is not considered CRU (customer replaceable unit) however the bottom plate is removable and does provide access to the battery which can be removed by unhooking the power cable to the board and a few screws. Always remember that you must disable the battery in the BIOS to absolutely safe!  Answered by: thinkpadGuru Date published: 2016-02-27 How many cores the ThinkPad T460s has? Four or two? Asked by: james173 Depends on the processor you select. Typically the 6th gen Intel i5 and i7 processors have 4 cores and the i3 has 2 cores. You can see the specs here http://ark.intel.com/ Answered by: JymM Date published: 2016-09-02 Does the 4GB edition(T460s) have another RAM slot? Asked by: DING Yes. I have added 16GB to my existing 4GB, making it 20GB.

In many ways, it is very similar to the T440s I replaced. It still has the great keyboard, the trackpad is better, it has a nice, non-reflective screen that looks and feels exactly the same, and it is very fast. However, this laptop is advertised as having "all day battery life". This is absolutely not true for my unit. I have gone through 9 charge cycles now, just typing and email, no videos or games, and the longest I ever got was about 4 hours. Typical are more 3-3.5 hours on one charge. Right now, I am on 31% with 56 minutes remaining. Date published: 2016-03-08 Rated 3 out of 5 by mattc from Battery life is severely lacking This is a great step in the right direction Lenovo - the screen and audio are great, the keyboard is what I'd expect from a modern lenovo, the build quality is sturdy, and the processor is snappy. Unfortunately the battery life is lacking. I'm lucky to get *3 hours* of unplugged time (at modest brightness under normal load) which is a far cry from the 10 hours touted. So, would I recommend this laptop? I wouldn't. I can only hope this machine represents an evolutionary step in Lenovo's design. It looks great. The size is fine. It just needs a significantly larger battery (think big here Lenovo - more is better). How about doubling or tripling what's inside? The fact that it's no longer using a hot swappable battery is fine so long as you can use that extra space to squeeze in more battery. Date published: 2016-03-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by DanielP from Workhorse with real power I've had this laptop for a month now, using it exclusively for all my computing, both personal and business, and it is outstanding. Under 10 seconds to boot, runs all my programs flawlessly, and the picture quality is so smooth and vibrant that I'm going to use it for Netfix too (I'm very picky about watching movies on computers - it has to look really good). If you're a touch typist, you will love the keyboard. The absolute best of any laptop I've tried. Good key travel and pressure for the right amount of feedback. I purchased this to replace another laptop and also a desktop, so I only have one computer moving forward. I'm extremely happy I made the choice of buying the T460s, as it has thus far served me well.

Can the battery ever be replaced if it begins to lose strength? Asked by: BobA2 Technically the battery is not considered CRU (customer replaceable unit) however the bottom plate is removable and does provide access to the battery which can be removed by unhooking the power cable to the board and a few screws. Always remember that you must disable the battery in the BIOS to absolutely safe!  Answered by: thinkpadGuru Date published: 2016-02-27 How many cores the ThinkPad T460s has? Four or two? Asked by: james173 Depends on the processor you select. Typically the 6th gen Intel i5 and i7 processors have 4 cores and the i3 has 2 cores. You can see the specs here http://ark.intel.com/ Answered by: JymM Date published: 2016-09-02 Does the 4GB edition(T460s) have another RAM slot? Asked by: DING Yes. I have added 16GB to my existing 4GB, making it 20GB.

Rated 2 out of 5 by Drjoe66 from Great keyboard, fast, horrible bettery life I have had this computer for 5 days now. In many ways, it is very similar to the T440s I replaced. It still has the great keyboard, the trackpad is better, it has a nice, non-reflective screen that looks and feels exactly the same, and it is very fast. However, this laptop is advertised as having "all day battery life". This is absolutely not true for my unit. I have gone through 9 charge cycles now, just typing and email, no videos or games, and the longest I ever got was about 4 hours. Typical are more 3-3.5 hours on one charge. Right now, I am on 31% with 56 minutes remaining. Date published: 2016-03-08 Rated 3 out of 5 by mattc from Battery life is severely lacking This is a great step in the right direction Lenovo - the screen and audio are great, the keyboard is what I'd expect from a modern lenovo, the build quality is sturdy, and the processor is snappy. Unfortunately the battery life is lacking. I'm lucky to get *3 hours* of unplugged time (at modest brightness under normal load) which is a far cry from the 10 hours touted. So, would I recommend this laptop? I wouldn't. I can only hope this machine represents an evolutionary step in Lenovo's design. It looks great. The size is fine. It just needs a significantly larger battery (think big here Lenovo - more is better). How about doubling or tripling what's inside? The fact that it's no longer using a hot swappable battery is fine so long as you can use that extra space to squeeze in more battery. Date published: 2016-03-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by DanielP from Workhorse with real power I've had this laptop for a month now, using it exclusively for all my computing, both personal and business, and it is outstanding. Under 10 seconds to boot, runs all my programs flawlessly, and the picture quality is so smooth and vibrant that I'm going to use it for Netfix too (I'm very picky about watching movies on computers - it has to look really good). If you're a touch typist, you will love the keyboard. The absolute best of any laptop I've tried. Good key travel and pressure for the right amount of feedback. I purchased this to replace another laptop and also a desktop, so I only have one computer moving forward. I'm extremely happy I made the choice of buying the T460s, as it has thus far served me well.

I understand this model does not have a removable battery. Can the battery ever be replaced if it begins to lose strength? Asked by: BobA2 Technically the battery is not considered CRU (customer replaceable unit) however the bottom plate is removable and does provide access to the battery which can be removed by unhooking the power cable to the board and a few screws. Always remember that you must disable the battery in the BIOS to absolutely safe!  Answered by: thinkpadGuru Date published: 2016-02-27 How many cores the ThinkPad T460s has? Four or two? Asked by: james173 Depends on the processor you select. Typically the 6th gen Intel i5 and i7 processors have 4 cores and the i3 has 2 cores. You can see the specs here http://ark.intel.com/ Answered by: JymM Date published: 2016-09-02 Does the 4GB edition(T460s) have another RAM slot? Asked by: DING Yes.
