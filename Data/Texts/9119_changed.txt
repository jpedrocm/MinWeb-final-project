The performance is great, battery life is decent, and it just looks amazing! This is, in my opinion, the best laptop ever! I absolutely love it! Date published: 2015-12-19 Rated 5 out of 5 by leosyoga from Exactly what I was looking for Like many, I research a great deal before making a purchase, especially technology and high priced items. I can positively say I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. The few critiques that I have with it are insignificant to the performance, convenience and overall us of this machine. First, Lenovo did a great job putting this machine together: full-tablet mode and full-laptop/netbook with full keyboard. Love it! The name couldn't have been more appropriate. The touchscreen is very responsive, as well as the keys (I'm writing this review on my Yoga 900). The performance is outstanding. This is a very-well built machine that not only perform well it looks amazing too! I've received many compliments about this machine. I enjoy watching mobile TV while washing the dishes. The track pad is highly responsive and no issues with it. The screen brightness is superb. The colors are amazing. The battery life is about average (around 6 hours say; I have about 3+ hours left on 48% battery at 100% screen brightness). I chose this over other 2-n-1s because I'm all about convenience without adding other accessories, such as having to lug around a separate keyboard. Some critiques, which are again minimal, but the two prongs on the charger could have been placed closer to the edge of the charger, instead of the center. Why does this matter: I can't plug anything else when I am charging my laptop because the charger takes over both top and bottom outlets. Second critique, the charging cable could have been made 2 feet longer. One major critique I almost forgot to mention because I saw that another person also mentioned it is the lack of LTE. Yes, this is a mobile device and the lack of LTE is something to be desired. With that said, because there is WIFI everywhere, including my phone, this has not been an issue for me and I therefore don't feel it to be an issue. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase as it has exceeded my expectations, especially since it cost a pretty penny or two. Date published: 2016-02-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by FShenouda from Cheap make and bad customer service In less than 2 months from purchase (Exactly 48 days), the end of the decorative links between the screen and keyboard fell off (Check Pictures). Contacted customer service, when they got back to me they only confirmed that it is still in warranty (Of course it is, didn't own it for 2 months yet). Not a single word that they are sorry about the cheap product being sold at that price point, or even sorry for my bad experience. Was really expecting much better after sale service. Will never buy a Lenove again, this was my first, and will definitely be my last.

Any user found it to be not a major concern? (maybe Chromcast all media plays to TV without the HDMI port)? Asked by: davidbe Most ultrabook/ultra small laptops have no space for regulation-size ports and always need some sort of "dongle" for their video connection, even if it's just micro-HDMI or mini-display port.  The 900's USB "C" port takes aftermarket dongles for HDMI, VGA, etc.  Unfortunately, its only native video is display-port through USB "C".  You'll have to spring for an adapter, most likely.

The performance is great, battery life is decent, and it just looks amazing! This is, in my opinion, the best laptop ever! I absolutely love it! Date published: 2015-12-19 Rated 5 out of 5 by leosyoga from Exactly what I was looking for Like many, I research a great deal before making a purchase, especially technology and high priced items. I can positively say I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. The few critiques that I have with it are insignificant to the performance, convenience and overall us of this machine. First, Lenovo did a great job putting this machine together: full-tablet mode and full-laptop/netbook with full keyboard. Love it! The name couldn't have been more appropriate. The touchscreen is very responsive, as well as the keys (I'm writing this review on my Yoga 900). The performance is outstanding. This is a very-well built machine that not only perform well it looks amazing too! I've received many compliments about this machine. I enjoy watching mobile TV while washing the dishes. The track pad is highly responsive and no issues with it. The screen brightness is superb. The colors are amazing. The battery life is about average (around 6 hours say; I have about 3+ hours left on 48% battery at 100% screen brightness). I chose this over other 2-n-1s because I'm all about convenience without adding other accessories, such as having to lug around a separate keyboard. Some critiques, which are again minimal, but the two prongs on the charger could have been placed closer to the edge of the charger, instead of the center. Why does this matter: I can't plug anything else when I am charging my laptop because the charger takes over both top and bottom outlets. Second critique, the charging cable could have been made 2 feet longer. One major critique I almost forgot to mention because I saw that another person also mentioned it is the lack of LTE. Yes, this is a mobile device and the lack of LTE is something to be desired. With that said, because there is WIFI everywhere, including my phone, this has not been an issue for me and I therefore don't feel it to be an issue. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase as it has exceeded my expectations, especially since it cost a pretty penny or two. Date published: 2016-02-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by FShenouda from Cheap make and bad customer service In less than 2 months from purchase (Exactly 48 days), the end of the decorative links between the screen and keyboard fell off (Check Pictures). Contacted customer service, when they got back to me they only confirmed that it is still in warranty (Of course it is, didn't own it for 2 months yet). Not a single word that they are sorry about the cheap product being sold at that price point, or even sorry for my bad experience. Was really expecting much better after sale service. Will never buy a Lenove again, this was my first, and will definitely be my last.

Any user found it to be not a major concern? (maybe Chromcast all media plays to TV without the HDMI port)? Asked by: davidbe Most ultrabook/ultra small laptops have no space for regulation-size ports and always need some sort of "dongle" for their video connection, even if it's just micro-HDMI or mini-display port.  The 900's USB "C" port takes aftermarket dongles for HDMI, VGA, etc.  Unfortunately, its only native video is display-port through USB "C".  You'll have to spring for an adapter, most likely.

Rated 5 out of 5 by EricXu100 from Excellent laptop, great successor to yoga 3 pro The Yoga 900 improved on the Yoga 3 Pro in every way possible: putting an Intel Core i7 processor, starting at 16GB Ram, a larger battery that offers great battery life, and making the hinge even sturdier than before. The performance is great, battery life is decent, and it just looks amazing! This is, in my opinion, the best laptop ever! I absolutely love it! Date published: 2015-12-19 Rated 5 out of 5 by leosyoga from Exactly what I was looking for Like many, I research a great deal before making a purchase, especially technology and high priced items. I can positively say I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. The few critiques that I have with it are insignificant to the performance, convenience and overall us of this machine. First, Lenovo did a great job putting this machine together: full-tablet mode and full-laptop/netbook with full keyboard. Love it! The name couldn't have been more appropriate. The touchscreen is very responsive, as well as the keys (I'm writing this review on my Yoga 900). The performance is outstanding. This is a very-well built machine that not only perform well it looks amazing too! I've received many compliments about this machine. I enjoy watching mobile TV while washing the dishes. The track pad is highly responsive and no issues with it. The screen brightness is superb. The colors are amazing. The battery life is about average (around 6 hours say; I have about 3+ hours left on 48% battery at 100% screen brightness). I chose this over other 2-n-1s because I'm all about convenience without adding other accessories, such as having to lug around a separate keyboard. Some critiques, which are again minimal, but the two prongs on the charger could have been placed closer to the edge of the charger, instead of the center. Why does this matter: I can't plug anything else when I am charging my laptop because the charger takes over both top and bottom outlets. Second critique, the charging cable could have been made 2 feet longer. One major critique I almost forgot to mention because I saw that another person also mentioned it is the lack of LTE. Yes, this is a mobile device and the lack of LTE is something to be desired. With that said, because there is WIFI everywhere, including my phone, this has not been an issue for me and I therefore don't feel it to be an issue. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase as it has exceeded my expectations, especially since it cost a pretty penny or two. Date published: 2016-02-15 Rated 1 out of 5 by FShenouda from Cheap make and bad customer service In less than 2 months from purchase (Exactly 48 days), the end of the decorative links between the screen and keyboard fell off (Check Pictures). Contacted customer service, when they got back to me they only confirmed that it is still in warranty (Of course it is, didn't own it for 2 months yet). Not a single word that they are sorry about the cheap product being sold at that price point, or even sorry for my bad experience. Was really expecting much better after sale service. Will never buy a Lenove again, this was my first, and will definitely be my last.

I am concerned about the lack of an HDMI port. Any user found it to be not a major concern? (maybe Chromcast all media plays to TV without the HDMI port)? Asked by: davidbe Most ultrabook/ultra small laptops have no space for regulation-size ports and always need some sort of "dongle" for their video connection, even if it's just micro-HDMI or mini-display port.  The 900's USB "C" port takes aftermarket dongles for HDMI, VGA, etc.  Unfortunately, its only native video is display-port through USB "C".  You'll have to spring for an adapter, most likely.
