Dislikes: 1. the battery life doesn't last long 2. The "Shift" key below the Enter key is too small. You always hit "PgUp" instead. Not sure who designed the keyboard but the person 3. The "Fn" key and the function keys above the numbers on the top of keyboard do not work as intended. The "Ctrl" key act as a function which is stupid. For example, if you have a program open, and if you hit "Alt" + "F4", it should close the program. However it doesn't do that on this keyboard.

Dislikes: 1. the battery life doesn't last long 2. The "Shift" key below the Enter key is too small. You always hit "PgUp" instead. Not sure who designed the keyboard but the person 3. The "Fn" key and the function keys above the numbers on the top of keyboard do not work as intended. The "Ctrl" key act as a function which is stupid. For example, if you have a program open, and if you hit "Alt" + "F4", it should close the program. However it doesn't do that on this keyboard. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by Asif from Ideapad 310 - 15.6 Touch 6th Gen i5,1TB,8GB Got the above config from Costo. Being in the profession of managing PC configuration for a big corporate, i must say this purchase is a good value for money. Date published: 2016-07-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by Castlehayne from Excellent purchase I've had my new Lenovo Ideapad 310 for about a month now and I just love using it.

Rated 2 out of 5 by Jaja from Average to below average product I bought this about a month ago and am not impressed with this. Dislikes: 1. the battery life doesn't last long 2. The "Shift" key below the Enter key is too small. You always hit "PgUp" instead. Not sure who designed the keyboard but the person 3. The "Fn" key and the function keys above the numbers on the top of keyboard do not work as intended. The "Ctrl" key act as a function which is stupid. For example, if you have a program open, and if you hit "Alt" + "F4", it should close the program. However it doesn't do that on this keyboard. Date published: 2016-09-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by Asif from Ideapad 310 - 15.6 Touch 6th Gen i5,1TB,8GB Got the above config from Costo. Being in the profession of managing PC configuration for a big corporate, i must say this purchase is a good value for money. Date published: 2016-07-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by Castlehayne from Excellent purchase I've had my new Lenovo Ideapad 310 for about a month now and I just love using it. Fast and light weight makes it easy to travel with. Love the number keypad and the size of the screen - crisp and sharp.
