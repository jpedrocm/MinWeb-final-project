A right click brings up an advanced menu where you can access the Device Manager, Control Panel and more. You will also be able to boot directly to the traditional desktop screen instead of the Windows 8.1 Start screen. Bing is the default search engine.

It's terrible. I can try dragging my finger across the touchpad and the cursor refuses to move. often, I have to drag my finger across the touch pad several times in order to get the cursor to finally move.

Weird designs like, pad is not sensitive AT ALL, many times it just has glitches that will drive me mad. I have to use a mouse instead. And the microphone..., if I plugged in ear bud, built-in microphone will be blocked. This makes me very hard to use when doing SkyPe.

Before buying this laptop, I heard a lot of good things about Toshiba laptop from the heavy users(on site engineers), but I saw a lot of bad things about Toshiba laptop on the hint where the connection between the screen and the laptop base. Anyway, I still wanted to try Toshiba laptop. I just started to use it, of course, I don't have problems with hints now, but I do have problems with the sensor of mouse that almost drive me crazy.

The 15.6" TruBrite LED-backlit display has a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1366 x 768 native resolution with native support for 720p HD content. The visuals are handled by integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000. The system is powered by a dual-core 3rd generation Ivy Bridge 1.8 GHz Intel Core i3-3217U processor. It also has 4GB of 1600 MHz DDR3L RAM, a 500GB 5400 rpm hard drive, a SuperMulti DVD burner, a multi-format media card reader with support for SD, SDHC, SDXC, and MMC (miniSD and microSD are also supported, but require an adapter), 10/100 Mbps Fast Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, an integrated webcam, and a microphone.

Product Overview? Back to Top The Satellite C55-B5246 15.6" Notebook Computer from Toshiba features a textured resin design with a jet black finish. The 15.6" TruBrite LED-backlit display has a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1366 x 768 native resolution with native support for 720p HD content. The visuals are handled by integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000. The system is powered by a dual-core 3rd generation Ivy Bridge 1.8 GHz Intel Core i3-3217U processor. It also has 4GB of 1600 MHz DDR3L RAM, a 500GB 5400 rpm hard drive, a SuperMulti DVD burner, a multi-format media card reader with support for SD, SDHC, SDXC, and MMC (miniSD and microSD are also supported, but require an adapter), 10/100 Mbps Fast Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, an integrated webcam, and a microphone. There are also built-in Skull Candy stereo speakers with DTS Sound technology. Windows 8.1 is the installed operating system.

A right click brings up an advanced menu where you can access the Device Manager, Control Panel and more. You will also be able to boot directly to the traditional desktop screen instead of the Windows 8.1 Start screen. Bing is the default search engine. Windows 8.1 provides a unique user experience that differs from previous versions of Windows.   Documents   'Owner's Manual'     'Specification Guide'   Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed...

Weird designs like, pad is not sensitive AT ALL, many times it just has glitches that will drive me mad. I have to use a mouse instead. And the microphone..., if I plugged in ear bud, built-in microphone will be blocked. This makes me very hard to use when doing SkyPe.

Before buying this laptop, I heard a lot of good things about Toshiba laptop from the heavy users(on site engineers), but I saw a lot of bad things about Toshiba laptop on the hint where the connection between the screen and the laptop base. Anyway, I still wanted to try Toshiba laptop. I just started to use it, of course, I don't have problems with hints now, but I do have problems with the sensor of mouse that almost drive me crazy.

8/3/2014   4.0 A mediocre laptop By BigM from San Jose, CA Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: An average product, I got what I paid for. Weird designs like, pad is not sensitive AT ALL, many times it just has glitches that will drive me mad. I have to use a mouse instead. And the microphone..., if I plugged in ear bud, built-in microphone will be blocked. This makes me very hard to use when doing SkyPe. Keyboard does not seem to come with a high quality material either. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review

7/23/2014   2.0 A little bit disapointed By Thoshiba lover from Schaumburg, IL Comments about Toshiba 15.6" Satellite Laptop Computer: The sensor of mouse is bad that a lot of time, it can't sensor my figure that it is hard or takes a long time to control the mouse on the screen. Before buying this laptop, I heard a lot of good things about Toshiba laptop from the heavy users(on site engineers), but I saw a lot of bad things about Toshiba laptop on the hint where the connection between the screen and the laptop base. Anyway, I still wanted to try Toshiba laptop. I just started to use it, of course, I don't have problems with hints now, but I do have problems with the sensor of mouse that almost drive me crazy. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend REVIEWED AT Was this review helpful? Yes / No  - You may also flag this review Comment on this review
