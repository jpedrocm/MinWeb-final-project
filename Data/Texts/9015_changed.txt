Pen latency is very good, but you’ll want to go into the NVidia settings and make sure your drawing programs are making use of the dedicated GPU. For most things, it sets and detects properly every time. I only had to make a single change with one program. Everything else just worked. Lenovo’s signature trackpoint nub and touchpad are back, with mechanical buttons. I had the version that lacked buttons on my S1 Yoga. I adapted to both with equal ease, I’m not sure why the uproar about the buttons, but they are back if you missed them. They are excellent, comparable to the best the rest of the market has to offer. There is pre-installed software to adjust the pen input, trackpoint, and trackpad. You can tune these inputs to your preference, and I recommend giving that a try. I don’t feel like these additions were obligatory, and users will get a lot of value out of making the machine comfortable to use. Power management on the P40 is just great. It comes with Lenovo’s own power management driver and software, and a custom profile in Windows itself. Basically, someone at Lenovo went in and ticked all the little boxes and set all the settings I would normally have to alter myself. The laptop boots, shuts down, goes to sleep, holds a charge, and manages power usage very well. The P40 was crafted and manufactured for digital artists, 3D modelers, and similar. Like I said before, if you’re used to having a Cintiq at your desk, this probably won’t replace that experience as there are no programmable buttons in tablet mode. But, if your desk is wherever you happen to be, and your feet often take you wandering, this device is pretty hard to beat. Once you’ve got Photoshop, Sketchbook Pro, or whatever you use set up how you like it, there very little hardware side to be concerned with. The pen input just works well, the hover distance is good, and accuracy is what you’d expect with ERM input. As I said previously, you’ll not get the parallax effect or have the offset toward the edges of the screen, making AES input a nice upgrade. As for drawing, inking, and doing pixel art, I can’t say enough good things. It’s amazing what you’ll tolerate when you want something portable and versatile and I made a lot of compromises with my S1 Yoga, both in the display and the performance. Little ticks and mannerisms I employed to deal with pen latency and screen burn just melt away when using the P40. It feels like I’ve been creating in a fog that sort of distorted and slowed down what I’ve been doing for the last two years, and it is suddenly gone. My inking is far better, thanks to the improved cursor accuracy and pressure sensitivity. I find myself shaving far fewer lines. Even when doing pixel art, I’m not having to move the canvas around dodging screen burn and adjusting for the parallax of the ERM pen input. Everything is faster, cleaner, and better than it was before. Rendering filters in Photoshop is twice as fast, and I can paint layer over layer as many as I like without worrying about impacting system performance. If I’m doing a very large 300 DPI landscape or building a deep .PSD sprite file with hundreds of layers, I don’t have to close all my other programs and browser windows to make the experience tolerable. Unity3D runs great on it, and I think I’ll be making a lot of games with the P40. Date published: 2016-03-17 Rated 1 out of 5 by Togotooner from A MAJOR Disappointment! I spent over $1700.00 on the high end P40 and all I needed it to do was work with 2 drawing programs as well as my old Motion tablet did. It failed on both counts. The pen will not produce a steady line when creating fast curves and when drawing diagonal lines at a slower pace. The pen lags a bit during a fast stroke in Sketchbook Pro and this is totally unacceptable considering it's touted speed and power. Funny how the same programs work beautifully on the old and tired Motion tablet. Now to add insult to injury,...Lenovo wants to take 30% of my money to restock this thing. That's just ridiculous. I will tell all of my peers about this experience. Date published: 2016-05-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by CW43 from Dissapointed I bought this laptop four months ago and it functioned well while it did but it slowly built up hardware issues where the screen would think I was touching it in the corner repeatedly, forcing me to restart, the headphone jack is loose and doesn't work half the time, the power button gets stuck, and sometimes the cursor just doesn't show up. I was really excited to have this laptop and see it work but these issues completely override any good quality of this laptop. It also just stopped turning on one day. Seriously disappointed. Hopefully warranty will replace this device and the replacement will actually function for more than a few months.

Can the mini-Displayport also output to HDMI and DVI? Asked by: Eye_In_The_Sky I did a bit of research. According to this link on support.Lenovo.com, the mDP-to-HDMI and mDP-to-DVI adapters are not supported on the P40 Yoga. https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/documents/SF16-T0022 I have also tested many different mDP adapters. This is not what I expected when I purchased the P40 Yoga. Why would Lenovo not enable mDP-to-HDMI and mDP-to-DVI as these capabilities are very standard on a lot of laptops? Is there a software fix? I may have to return my P40 Yoga. Answered by: Eye_In_The_Sky Date published: 2016-10-03 can a 2rd ssd drive (m2 pcie, m2 sata, etc... any interface would be accepted for me ) be able to be added to P40 yoga? two physical harddrives are required in order to meet our company's IT security policy... Asked by: hayden you Yes, a second SSD can most certainly be added. The form factor is M.2. I am not certain about the interface, but I would guess it's PCIe because the slot for the second SSD doubles as the slot for the WWAN card. See here: support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/Laptops-and-netbooks/ThinkPad-P-Series-laptops/ThinkPad-P40-Yoga/parts/PD103936 Answered by: Some1 Date published: 2016-04-04 Just to clarify another answer: the OEM SSD is in the M2 slot and the buyer can add a hard drive or second SSD in the SATA3 slot? Asked by: JanseJr1 Lenovo includes a 2.5" SSD in the SATA3 slot. Another SSD can be added in the M.2 slot.

Pen latency is very good, but you’ll want to go into the NVidia settings and make sure your drawing programs are making use of the dedicated GPU. For most things, it sets and detects properly every time. I only had to make a single change with one program. Everything else just worked. Lenovo’s signature trackpoint nub and touchpad are back, with mechanical buttons. I had the version that lacked buttons on my S1 Yoga. I adapted to both with equal ease, I’m not sure why the uproar about the buttons, but they are back if you missed them. They are excellent, comparable to the best the rest of the market has to offer. There is pre-installed software to adjust the pen input, trackpoint, and trackpad. You can tune these inputs to your preference, and I recommend giving that a try. I don’t feel like these additions were obligatory, and users will get a lot of value out of making the machine comfortable to use. Power management on the P40 is just great. It comes with Lenovo’s own power management driver and software, and a custom profile in Windows itself. Basically, someone at Lenovo went in and ticked all the little boxes and set all the settings I would normally have to alter myself. The laptop boots, shuts down, goes to sleep, holds a charge, and manages power usage very well. The P40 was crafted and manufactured for digital artists, 3D modelers, and similar. Like I said before, if you’re used to having a Cintiq at your desk, this probably won’t replace that experience as there are no programmable buttons in tablet mode. But, if your desk is wherever you happen to be, and your feet often take you wandering, this device is pretty hard to beat. Once you’ve got Photoshop, Sketchbook Pro, or whatever you use set up how you like it, there very little hardware side to be concerned with. The pen input just works well, the hover distance is good, and accuracy is what you’d expect with ERM input. As I said previously, you’ll not get the parallax effect or have the offset toward the edges of the screen, making AES input a nice upgrade. As for drawing, inking, and doing pixel art, I can’t say enough good things. It’s amazing what you’ll tolerate when you want something portable and versatile and I made a lot of compromises with my S1 Yoga, both in the display and the performance. Little ticks and mannerisms I employed to deal with pen latency and screen burn just melt away when using the P40. It feels like I’ve been creating in a fog that sort of distorted and slowed down what I’ve been doing for the last two years, and it is suddenly gone. My inking is far better, thanks to the improved cursor accuracy and pressure sensitivity. I find myself shaving far fewer lines. Even when doing pixel art, I’m not having to move the canvas around dodging screen burn and adjusting for the parallax of the ERM pen input. Everything is faster, cleaner, and better than it was before. Rendering filters in Photoshop is twice as fast, and I can paint layer over layer as many as I like without worrying about impacting system performance. If I’m doing a very large 300 DPI landscape or building a deep .PSD sprite file with hundreds of layers, I don’t have to close all my other programs and browser windows to make the experience tolerable. Unity3D runs great on it, and I think I’ll be making a lot of games with the P40. Date published: 2016-03-17 Rated 1 out of 5 by Togotooner from A MAJOR Disappointment! I spent over $1700.00 on the high end P40 and all I needed it to do was work with 2 drawing programs as well as my old Motion tablet did. It failed on both counts. The pen will not produce a steady line when creating fast curves and when drawing diagonal lines at a slower pace. The pen lags a bit during a fast stroke in Sketchbook Pro and this is totally unacceptable considering it's touted speed and power. Funny how the same programs work beautifully on the old and tired Motion tablet. Now to add insult to injury,...Lenovo wants to take 30% of my money to restock this thing. That's just ridiculous. I will tell all of my peers about this experience. Date published: 2016-05-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by CW43 from Dissapointed I bought this laptop four months ago and it functioned well while it did but it slowly built up hardware issues where the screen would think I was touching it in the corner repeatedly, forcing me to restart, the headphone jack is loose and doesn't work half the time, the power button gets stuck, and sometimes the cursor just doesn't show up. I was really excited to have this laptop and see it work but these issues completely override any good quality of this laptop. It also just stopped turning on one day. Seriously disappointed. Hopefully warranty will replace this device and the replacement will actually function for more than a few months.

Can the mini-Displayport also output to HDMI and DVI? Asked by: Eye_In_The_Sky I did a bit of research. According to this link on support.Lenovo.com, the mDP-to-HDMI and mDP-to-DVI adapters are not supported on the P40 Yoga. https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/documents/SF16-T0022 I have also tested many different mDP adapters. This is not what I expected when I purchased the P40 Yoga. Why would Lenovo not enable mDP-to-HDMI and mDP-to-DVI as these capabilities are very standard on a lot of laptops? Is there a software fix? I may have to return my P40 Yoga. Answered by: Eye_In_The_Sky Date published: 2016-10-03 can a 2rd ssd drive (m2 pcie, m2 sata, etc... any interface would be accepted for me ) be able to be added to P40 yoga? two physical harddrives are required in order to meet our company's IT security policy... Asked by: hayden you Yes, a second SSD can most certainly be added. The form factor is M.2. I am not certain about the interface, but I would guess it's PCIe because the slot for the second SSD doubles as the slot for the WWAN card. See here: support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/Laptops-and-netbooks/ThinkPad-P-Series-laptops/ThinkPad-P40-Yoga/parts/PD103936 Answered by: Some1 Date published: 2016-04-04 Just to clarify another answer: the OEM SSD is in the M2 slot and the buyer can add a hard drive or second SSD in the SATA3 slot? Asked by: JanseJr1 Lenovo includes a 2.5" SSD in the SATA3 slot. Another SSD can be added in the M.2 slot.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Leafworth from A Workstation for the Digital Content Creator If you need a compact device that has as many input options as possible, the P40 is an excellent choice. Pen latency is very good, but you’ll want to go into the NVidia settings and make sure your drawing programs are making use of the dedicated GPU. For most things, it sets and detects properly every time. I only had to make a single change with one program. Everything else just worked. Lenovo’s signature trackpoint nub and touchpad are back, with mechanical buttons. I had the version that lacked buttons on my S1 Yoga. I adapted to both with equal ease, I’m not sure why the uproar about the buttons, but they are back if you missed them. They are excellent, comparable to the best the rest of the market has to offer. There is pre-installed software to adjust the pen input, trackpoint, and trackpad. You can tune these inputs to your preference, and I recommend giving that a try. I don’t feel like these additions were obligatory, and users will get a lot of value out of making the machine comfortable to use. Power management on the P40 is just great. It comes with Lenovo’s own power management driver and software, and a custom profile in Windows itself. Basically, someone at Lenovo went in and ticked all the little boxes and set all the settings I would normally have to alter myself. The laptop boots, shuts down, goes to sleep, holds a charge, and manages power usage very well. The P40 was crafted and manufactured for digital artists, 3D modelers, and similar. Like I said before, if you’re used to having a Cintiq at your desk, this probably won’t replace that experience as there are no programmable buttons in tablet mode. But, if your desk is wherever you happen to be, and your feet often take you wandering, this device is pretty hard to beat. Once you’ve got Photoshop, Sketchbook Pro, or whatever you use set up how you like it, there very little hardware side to be concerned with. The pen input just works well, the hover distance is good, and accuracy is what you’d expect with ERM input. As I said previously, you’ll not get the parallax effect or have the offset toward the edges of the screen, making AES input a nice upgrade. As for drawing, inking, and doing pixel art, I can’t say enough good things. It’s amazing what you’ll tolerate when you want something portable and versatile and I made a lot of compromises with my S1 Yoga, both in the display and the performance. Little ticks and mannerisms I employed to deal with pen latency and screen burn just melt away when using the P40. It feels like I’ve been creating in a fog that sort of distorted and slowed down what I’ve been doing for the last two years, and it is suddenly gone. My inking is far better, thanks to the improved cursor accuracy and pressure sensitivity. I find myself shaving far fewer lines. Even when doing pixel art, I’m not having to move the canvas around dodging screen burn and adjusting for the parallax of the ERM pen input. Everything is faster, cleaner, and better than it was before. Rendering filters in Photoshop is twice as fast, and I can paint layer over layer as many as I like without worrying about impacting system performance. If I’m doing a very large 300 DPI landscape or building a deep .PSD sprite file with hundreds of layers, I don’t have to close all my other programs and browser windows to make the experience tolerable. Unity3D runs great on it, and I think I’ll be making a lot of games with the P40. Date published: 2016-03-17 Rated 1 out of 5 by Togotooner from A MAJOR Disappointment! I spent over $1700.00 on the high end P40 and all I needed it to do was work with 2 drawing programs as well as my old Motion tablet did. It failed on both counts. The pen will not produce a steady line when creating fast curves and when drawing diagonal lines at a slower pace. The pen lags a bit during a fast stroke in Sketchbook Pro and this is totally unacceptable considering it's touted speed and power. Funny how the same programs work beautifully on the old and tired Motion tablet. Now to add insult to injury,...Lenovo wants to take 30% of my money to restock this thing. That's just ridiculous. I will tell all of my peers about this experience. Date published: 2016-05-25 Rated 2 out of 5 by CW43 from Dissapointed I bought this laptop four months ago and it functioned well while it did but it slowly built up hardware issues where the screen would think I was touching it in the corner repeatedly, forcing me to restart, the headphone jack is loose and doesn't work half the time, the power button gets stuck, and sometimes the cursor just doesn't show up. I was really excited to have this laptop and see it work but these issues completely override any good quality of this laptop. It also just stopped turning on one day. Seriously disappointed. Hopefully warranty will replace this device and the replacement will actually function for more than a few months.

Does the mini-Displayport on the P40 Yoga output to VGA only? Can the mini-Displayport also output to HDMI and DVI? Asked by: Eye_In_The_Sky I did a bit of research. According to this link on support.Lenovo.com, the mDP-to-HDMI and mDP-to-DVI adapters are not supported on the P40 Yoga. https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/documents/SF16-T0022 I have also tested many different mDP adapters. This is not what I expected when I purchased the P40 Yoga. Why would Lenovo not enable mDP-to-HDMI and mDP-to-DVI as these capabilities are very standard on a lot of laptops? Is there a software fix? I may have to return my P40 Yoga. Answered by: Eye_In_The_Sky Date published: 2016-10-03 can a 2rd ssd drive (m2 pcie, m2 sata, etc... any interface would be accepted for me ) be able to be added to P40 yoga? two physical harddrives are required in order to meet our company's IT security policy... Asked by: hayden you Yes, a second SSD can most certainly be added. The form factor is M.2. I am not certain about the interface, but I would guess it's PCIe because the slot for the second SSD doubles as the slot for the WWAN card.

can a 2rd ssd drive (m2 pcie, m2 sata, etc... any interface would be accepted for me ) be able to be added to P40 yoga? two physical harddrives are required in order to meet our company's IT security policy...

Yes, a second SSD can most certainly be added. The form factor is M.2.

Just to clarify another answer: the OEM SSD is in the M2 slot and the buyer can add a hard drive or second SSD in the SATA3 slot? Asked by: JanseJr1 Lenovo includes a 2.5" SSD in the SATA3 slot. Another SSD can be added in the M.2 slot. Answered by: Some1 Date published: 2016-04-04
