More power in every millimeter Harness full Intel® Core™ i power*, with the cutting-edge hyperbaric cooling system. HP's unique approach to cooling to enable Intel® Core™ i performance Equipping a device so thin with this much power requires a special approach to cooling. Breakthrough hyperbaric cooling technology from Intel® actively draws cool air in, rather than just venting heat out. This allows us to utilize a more powerful processor without overheating. Combined with dynamic power settings that adjust to your workload, this laptop keeps cool and stays at peak performance. Breakthrough in cooling Our breakthrough hyperbaric cooling system doesn't just push heat out of the machine - it actually draws in cool air and directs it over the processor, to keep it running at peak performance.
