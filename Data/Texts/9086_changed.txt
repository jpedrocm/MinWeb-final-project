Keeps the laptop cool, but slows it down. The fan speed is triggered by different temperatures. As the laptop gets hotter, the fans increase in speed to cool it down. But because the laptop slows down performance once the low temperature of 67 degrees Celsius is hit, the fans never get a chance to ramp up and cool the system down. I can't recommend this laptop for gaming until 2 things happen: 1) Fans are programmed to be more aggressive, reaching their maximum speeds sooner to keep the laptop from throttling. After all, whats the point of a better cooling system if the laptop won't run fast enough to even trigger it? 2) The maximum temperature before the laptop throttles back performance needs to be increased. It's currently at about 67C, it needs to be at 80c. The components inside can go up to 88C safely and not have any problems so the proposed max of 80c is still conservative. Both of the above need to happen in order to get great performance. I've attached two photos showing the voltage, temperature, and speed (frequency) of the GPU during a gaming session. You can see the throttle for yourself. I didn't screen shot the CPU but it behaves in a similar manner, slowing down at 67C. It doesn't show fan speed, but the maximum speed they reached was about 40% total capacity so they weren't even working their hardest during the temp throttle. Date published: 2015-12-05 Rated 4 out of 5 by Joshglass1 from Good Laptop I have gone through many laptops through the years. I was extremely excited to get this one. I will start off, overall this is a good laptop. It's reliable and does what I need. With that said, it is slow. I am going to replace the 1 TB hard drive that came with it for a SSD upgrade in hopes that it speeds it up. I write software so this is a must. I am also going to upgrade the RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB. I found that the back of the laptop is a bit difficult to take off for doing upgrades. The mouse buttons are not the best. I use my external mouse for better button functionality. I wish manufactures would leave off the bloat ware. Date published: 2016-02-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by bskrb12 from Great laptop for the price This laptop achieves almost all of my objectives from school, work to its main motive, gaming. Even though I rarely use it for gaming purpose, its "about" high-end specs solves most of my tasks. Studying computational physics, I needed a fast laptop with better display and processing power. It performs as a mobile workstation for me carrying out 3D modeling as well as normal coding. I can only think of some limitations of the laptop, namely, the low battery life, only satisfactory track-pad and its finger-magnet surfaces. These downsides, however, gets foreshadowed by its beautiful design, its robust specs and its low price.

Asked by: Nick in CO It does not. Answered by: C4LEN Date published: 2016-09-04 128GB SSD with 1TB 5400rpm-is the SSD drive available to load programs & files onto? Customer svc said no-its only a booster to the 5400 drive. 1 rep frm sales also told me no, but another & her 2 suprvisors insisted that you can write to it -pls clarify! Asked by: vic57 To anybody whose getting the 128 SSD + 1TB 5400RPM. Just get the 512 SSD. There is no "booster" to an RPM Hard Drive so customer service is wrong.  Answered by: Anonymous Date published: 2015-12-19 Any Ultra HD Models?

Keeps the laptop cool, but slows it down. The fan speed is triggered by different temperatures. As the laptop gets hotter, the fans increase in speed to cool it down. But because the laptop slows down performance once the low temperature of 67 degrees Celsius is hit, the fans never get a chance to ramp up and cool the system down. I can't recommend this laptop for gaming until 2 things happen: 1) Fans are programmed to be more aggressive, reaching their maximum speeds sooner to keep the laptop from throttling. After all, whats the point of a better cooling system if the laptop won't run fast enough to even trigger it? 2) The maximum temperature before the laptop throttles back performance needs to be increased. It's currently at about 67C, it needs to be at 80c. The components inside can go up to 88C safely and not have any problems so the proposed max of 80c is still conservative. Both of the above need to happen in order to get great performance. I've attached two photos showing the voltage, temperature, and speed (frequency) of the GPU during a gaming session. You can see the throttle for yourself. I didn't screen shot the CPU but it behaves in a similar manner, slowing down at 67C. It doesn't show fan speed, but the maximum speed they reached was about 40% total capacity so they weren't even working their hardest during the temp throttle. Date published: 2015-12-05 Rated 4 out of 5 by Joshglass1 from Good Laptop I have gone through many laptops through the years. I was extremely excited to get this one. I will start off, overall this is a good laptop. It's reliable and does what I need. With that said, it is slow. I am going to replace the 1 TB hard drive that came with it for a SSD upgrade in hopes that it speeds it up. I write software so this is a must. I am also going to upgrade the RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB. I found that the back of the laptop is a bit difficult to take off for doing upgrades. The mouse buttons are not the best. I use my external mouse for better button functionality. I wish manufactures would leave off the bloat ware. Date published: 2016-02-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by bskrb12 from Great laptop for the price This laptop achieves almost all of my objectives from school, work to its main motive, gaming. Even though I rarely use it for gaming purpose, its "about" high-end specs solves most of my tasks. Studying computational physics, I needed a fast laptop with better display and processing power. It performs as a mobile workstation for me carrying out 3D modeling as well as normal coding. I can only think of some limitations of the laptop, namely, the low battery life, only satisfactory track-pad and its finger-magnet surfaces. These downsides, however, gets foreshadowed by its beautiful design, its robust specs and its low price.

Asked by: Nick in CO It does not. Answered by: C4LEN Date published: 2016-09-04 128GB SSD with 1TB 5400rpm-is the SSD drive available to load programs & files onto? Customer svc said no-its only a booster to the 5400 drive. 1 rep frm sales also told me no, but another & her 2 suprvisors insisted that you can write to it -pls clarify! Asked by: vic57 To anybody whose getting the 128 SSD + 1TB 5400RPM. Just get the 512 SSD. There is no "booster" to an RPM Hard Drive so customer service is wrong.  Answered by: Anonymous Date published: 2015-12-19 Any Ultra HD Models? Asked by: Lex Gamer The site itself is set up a little different than normal but after becoming accustomed to how Lenovo displayed different variations, there are options for 4K/UHD.

Rated 3 out of 5 by Mikel0181 from Laptop throttles at low temperature CPU and GPU dial back once temperature hits 67C. Keeps the laptop cool, but slows it down. The fan speed is triggered by different temperatures. As the laptop gets hotter, the fans increase in speed to cool it down. But because the laptop slows down performance once the low temperature of 67 degrees Celsius is hit, the fans never get a chance to ramp up and cool the system down. I can't recommend this laptop for gaming until 2 things happen: 1) Fans are programmed to be more aggressive, reaching their maximum speeds sooner to keep the laptop from throttling. After all, whats the point of a better cooling system if the laptop won't run fast enough to even trigger it? 2) The maximum temperature before the laptop throttles back performance needs to be increased. It's currently at about 67C, it needs to be at 80c. The components inside can go up to 88C safely and not have any problems so the proposed max of 80c is still conservative. Both of the above need to happen in order to get great performance. I've attached two photos showing the voltage, temperature, and speed (frequency) of the GPU during a gaming session. You can see the throttle for yourself. I didn't screen shot the CPU but it behaves in a similar manner, slowing down at 67C. It doesn't show fan speed, but the maximum speed they reached was about 40% total capacity so they weren't even working their hardest during the temp throttle. Date published: 2015-12-05 Rated 4 out of 5 by Joshglass1 from Good Laptop I have gone through many laptops through the years. I was extremely excited to get this one. I will start off, overall this is a good laptop. It's reliable and does what I need. With that said, it is slow. I am going to replace the 1 TB hard drive that came with it for a SSD upgrade in hopes that it speeds it up. I write software so this is a must. I am also going to upgrade the RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB. I found that the back of the laptop is a bit difficult to take off for doing upgrades. The mouse buttons are not the best. I use my external mouse for better button functionality. I wish manufactures would leave off the bloat ware. Date published: 2016-02-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by bskrb12 from Great laptop for the price This laptop achieves almost all of my objectives from school, work to its main motive, gaming. Even though I rarely use it for gaming purpose, its "about" high-end specs solves most of my tasks. Studying computational physics, I needed a fast laptop with better display and processing power. It performs as a mobile workstation for me carrying out 3D modeling as well as normal coding. I can only think of some limitations of the laptop, namely, the low battery life, only satisfactory track-pad and its finger-magnet surfaces. These downsides, however, gets foreshadowed by its beautiful design, its robust specs and its low price.

Just to clarify from the specs, does the Y700 15" Touch have a built in DVD drive? Asked by: Nick in CO It does not. Answered by: C4LEN Date published: 2016-09-04 128GB SSD with 1TB 5400rpm-is the SSD drive available to load programs & files onto? Customer svc said no-its only a booster to the 5400 drive. 1 rep frm sales also told me no, but another & her 2 suprvisors insisted that you can write to it -pls clarify! Asked by: vic57 To anybody whose getting the 128 SSD + 1TB 5400RPM. Just get the 512 SSD. There is no "booster" to an RPM Hard Drive so customer service is wrong.  Answered by: Anonymous Date published: 2015-12-19 Any Ultra HD Models?
