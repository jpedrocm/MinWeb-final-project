It's great for editing complex documents, business use, editing photos, and anything else you do throughout the day. Full HD computing From streaming films to editing photos, you can expect everything on-screen to look its best thanks to the Full HD screen and Intel® Iris™ graphics. The Intel® Iris™ graphics give you clearer detail and more natural colours, so you can edit photos easily and know exactly how they'll look when they're printed. Powerful Intel® Core™ i7 processing The IdeaPad 510S is powered by an Intel® Core™ i7 processor that's more than capable of delivering fast everyday computing that won't leave you waiting. It's also powerful enough to run industry standard creative software, such as FL Studio and InDesign, for high-end computing on the go. It features Turbo Boost technology, which matches the speed the processor runs at to whatever you're doing. If you're just watching a film the processing speed is reduced to save battery life, but jumps back up again as soon as you open demanding software or start to work. Comfortable and accurate Lenovo's exclusive AccuType keyboard is designed to keep you comfortable when typing long documents. The keys are shaped to prevent your wrists from getting sore and to help you type more accurately - great for students or business use. Solid-state storage All the files you save on the IdealPad 510S are stored on a solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than a normal hard drive, this 256 GB SSD reduces the load times on software and helps it to boot up in seconds. Microsoft Office & Internet security This laptop doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

It's also powerful enough to run industry standard creative software, such as FL Studio and InDesign, for high-end computing on the go. It features Turbo Boost technology, which matches the speed the processor runs at to whatever you're doing. If you're just watching a film the processing speed is reduced to save battery life, but jumps back up again as soon as you open demanding software or start to work. Comfortable and accurate Lenovo's exclusive AccuType keyboard is designed to keep you comfortable when typing long documents. The keys are shaped to prevent your wrists from getting sore and to help you type more accurately - great for students or business use. Solid-state storage All the files you save on the IdealPad 510S are stored on a solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than a normal hard drive, this 256 GB SSD reduces the load times on software and helps it to boot up in seconds. Microsoft Office & Internet security This laptop doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

Powerful Intel® Core™ i7 processing The IdeaPad 510S is powered by an Intel® Core™ i7 processor that's more than capable of delivering fast everyday computing that won't leave you waiting. It's also powerful enough to run industry standard creative software, such as FL Studio and InDesign, for high-end computing on the go. It features Turbo Boost technology, which matches the speed the processor runs at to whatever you're doing. If you're just watching a film the processing speed is reduced to save battery life, but jumps back up again as soon as you open demanding software or start to work. Comfortable and accurate Lenovo's exclusive AccuType keyboard is designed to keep you comfortable when typing long documents. The keys are shaped to prevent your wrists from getting sore and to help you type more accurately - great for students or business use. Solid-state storage All the files you save on the IdealPad 510S are stored on a solid-state drive (SSD). With much faster data transfer speeds than a normal hard drive, this 256 GB SSD reduces the load times on software and helps it to boot up in seconds. Microsoft Office & Internet security This laptop doesn't come with a full version of Microsoft Office or Internet Security. But don't worry, you'll find great savings on software with the bundles available on the ‘Top Deals' tab on this page. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, Xeon Phi and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
