After one school year most are damaged. They are very heavy and the poor kids have to carry these around all day. I would not recommend these. Not good value for money. Date published: 2016-08-11 Rated 1 out of 5 by tighe from Terrible My school supplied this computer for me and it is horrible. I'm a computer nerd so instantly I went and read the specs of this product, and I almost vomited. Their are so many better choices for this price tag, and I would not recommend this laptop. Hope this helped.

Rated 1 out of 5 by lille06830 from Not durable for student use My son's school gave the kids these. After one school year most are damaged. They are very heavy and the poor kids have to carry these around all day. I would not recommend these. Not good value for money. Date published: 2016-08-11 Rated 1 out of 5 by tighe from Terrible My school supplied this computer for me and it is horrible. I'm a computer nerd so instantly I went and read the specs of this product, and I almost vomited. Their are so many better choices for this price tag, and I would not recommend this laptop. Hope this helped.
