It'll run many of today's most popular games at medium to high settings at over 50 frames per second for an immersive gaming experience anywhere. The Full HD screen has the same resolution as many TVs and monitors and displays your games and media with precise detail. From gaming with friends to watching films on the commute, everything you view will look its best. Quad-core Intel® i7 processing There's no need to worry about whether the processor can keep up with the graphics card. Powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor, the Optimus VII is more than ready for this and the next generation of gaming. And when combined with 12 GB of RAM, the Optimus is capable of running most design, media editing, and music production software, so you can game and create from a single portable PC. Dual storage Most laptops either have a large capacity hard drive or a high-performance solid-state drive. The Optimus VII has both. This allows you storage large amounts of data, such as music and films, on hard drive and save the SSD for games. Any games installed on the SSD will run smoother and benefit from significantly reduced loading times - great for quickly getting into the action when playing huge open world games. Built for gaming Alongside being built from some of the most respected gaming brands, including NVIDIA for the graphics and Kingston for the RAM, the Optimus has touches made with gaming in mind. You can game in any light conditions as the keyboard is backlit, which looks impressive and makes hitting the correct keys easy even if you're gaming with the lights off. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

We'll only use these to contact you about this item. Title Mr. Mrs. Miss. Ms. Dr. First name Last name Email * * We'll need this to email you Submit Please click here to view similar products. Product features Windows 10 (pre-installed) Intel® Core™ i7-6700HQ Processor Memory: 12 GB Storage: 1 TB & 240 GB SSD Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M Save £20 off Microsoft Office when you buy with any laptop More info Save £60 off McAfee LiveSafe Security when you buy with any laptop More info Read 1 customer reviews Ask an owner 1 customer reviews Product information Specification Customer reviews Delivery, Order & Collect and Services Top deals 2 Product information Highlights - NVIDIA GeForce graphics lets you enjoy enthusiast-level gaming wherever you are - Full HD screen displays your games clearly, with bright colours and sharp detail - The powerful quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor delivers fast gaming, creative computing and more - Dual storage combines large capacity and performance hard drives for responsive everyday computing Gaming on the go Whether you're enjoying the biggest triple-A releases or exploring your favourite MMO away from home, you can expect smooth and responsive gaming thanks to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M graphics card. It'll run many of today's most popular games at medium to high settings at over 50 frames per second for an immersive gaming experience anywhere. The Full HD screen has the same resolution as many TVs and monitors and displays your games and media with precise detail. From gaming with friends to watching films on the commute, everything you view will look its best. Quad-core Intel® i7 processing There's no need to worry about whether the processor can keep up with the graphics card. Powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor, the Optimus VII is more than ready for this and the next generation of gaming. And when combined with 12 GB of RAM, the Optimus is capable of running most design, media editing, and music production software, so you can game and create from a single portable PC. Dual storage Most laptops either have a large capacity hard drive or a high-performance solid-state drive. The Optimus VII has both. This allows you storage large amounts of data, such as music and films, on hard drive and save the SSD for games. Any games installed on the SSD will run smoother and benefit from significantly reduced loading times - great for quickly getting into the action when playing huge open world games. Built for gaming Alongside being built from some of the most respected gaming brands, including NVIDIA for the graphics and Kingston for the RAM, the Optimus has touches made with gaming in mind. You can game in any light conditions as the keyboard is backlit, which looks impressive and makes hitting the correct keys easy even if you're gaming with the lights off. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.

It'll run many of today's most popular games at medium to high settings at over 50 frames per second for an immersive gaming experience anywhere. The Full HD screen has the same resolution as many TVs and monitors and displays your games and media with precise detail. From gaming with friends to watching films on the commute, everything you view will look its best. Quad-core Intel® i7 processing There's no need to worry about whether the processor can keep up with the graphics card. Powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor, the Optimus VII is more than ready for this and the next generation of gaming. And when combined with 12 GB of RAM, the Optimus is capable of running most design, media editing, and music production software, so you can game and create from a single portable PC. Dual storage Most laptops either have a large capacity hard drive or a high-performance solid-state drive. The Optimus VII has both. This allows you storage large amounts of data, such as music and films, on hard drive and save the SSD for games. Any games installed on the SSD will run smoother and benefit from significantly reduced loading times - great for quickly getting into the action when playing huge open world games.

Quad-core Intel® i7 processing There's no need to worry about whether the processor can keep up with the graphics card. Powered by a quad-core Intel® Core™ i7 processor, the Optimus VII is more than ready for this and the next generation of gaming. And when combined with 12 GB of RAM, the Optimus is capable of running most design, media editing, and music production software, so you can game and create from a single portable PC. Dual storage Most laptops either have a large capacity hard drive or a high-performance solid-state drive. The Optimus VII has both. This allows you storage large amounts of data, such as music and films, on hard drive and save the SSD for games. Any games installed on the SSD will run smoother and benefit from significantly reduced loading times - great for quickly getting into the action when playing huge open world games. Built for gaming Alongside being built from some of the most respected gaming brands, including NVIDIA for the graphics and Kingston for the RAM, the Optimus has touches made with gaming in mind. You can game in any light conditions as the keyboard is backlit, which looks impressive and makes hitting the correct keys easy even if you're gaming with the lights off. ___________________________________________________________________________ Ultrabook, Celeron, Celeron Inside, Core Inside, Intel, Intel Logo, Intel Atom, Intel Atom Inside, Intel Core, Intel Inside, Intel Inside Logo, Intel vPro, Itanium, Itanium Inside, Pentium, Pentium Inside, vPro Inside, Xeon, and Xeon Inside are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries.
