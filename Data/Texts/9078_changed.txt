Build quality is incredible. Much better than the w701DS I was lugging around. Screen is fantastic. Keyboard very nice feel. Easier than ever to install but part of that credit goes to Windows 10 which is much better at setting up devices. I loaded it with 64 Gig of memory to run multiple VM's at once. Seems up to the task so far. Put in a 2 gig SSD to hold the VM's. Easy install. I have the dock and I can report that the thunderbolt / type C ports are accessible and work as USB type C while docked. Very pleased. If it last as long as the W701ds, 5+ years, I'll be very happy. Date published: 2016-01-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by wrosing from Wow! I just received a P70. The speed of the system is noticeably better than my current W550s -- which is saying something. Open Gl and Autocad Inventor graphics shine. I am not sure this is the "Retro" machine people have been talking about. if it is, the moniker might be fun, but this is a great laptop. Admittedly it is a bit large and heavier than usual. But that is the point! It has plenty of ports, a DVD, capacity for a lot of RAM. The slightly larger keyboard happens to correspond with my normal workstation keyboard -- so much so touch typing feels totally familiar. I cannot accurately rate Reliability yet, but it did work out of the box. :) Date published: 2016-01-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by practical from Excellent performance, good feature set. A very powerful machine, generally well-designed for power users. PCI NVMe drives are outstanding and amazingly fast--boot times are astonishing. Memory capacity is up to snuff at up to 64 GM RAM. 4K screen is clear, sharp and excellent. Xeon iCPU s a great option. Large physical buttons for TrackPad and TrackPoint have returned and function very well. New keyboard design is comfortable and functional although not as elegant as the older Selectric-style keyboards of the original 17" workstation models. Wish an option for Bluray drive was available. Overall, I am very satisfied and highly recommend the P70. Those seeking to replace older ThinkPad workstations not have an excellent option.

The secondary SSD is too pricey. I'm confused on the number of hard drives I can add beyond the two SSD mentioned. What can I select and what can I add later? Asked by: jerry200 I purchased the P70 with 2 512gb SSDs (C: D:), and added 2 more 512gb HDD - one replaced the DVD tray. Then I purchased 2 Samsung 2TB Pro SSD, replaced the 512HDD and now I have 5TB SSD onboard. Yes, it added almost $2,000 to the already $7,200 cost of the laptop but it is really nice! No problems at all. Answered by: BobP Date published: 2016-04-01 Are the P70 Screens glossy or untiglage? Asked by: Dave Rider Not glossy, no reflection, I love mine Answered by: WJICS Date published: 2016-09-27 How is the heat dissipation on the Thinkpad 70 ??? I've never owned a larger laptop where the heat buildup didn't shut my laptops down or cause headaches elsewhere. No one ever mentions it in tech specs, what can I expect with this one???? Asked by: EdziufromGreenpoint Mine is shipping now. I read 20 online reviews before buying and they all made positive comments on the cooling.  Let you know in a week or two.  Answered by: CaliforniaConsumer Date published: 2016-09-21 W700 Questions - page 2 2016-10-16T08:31CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvqa, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasquestionsanswers, tq_97 loc_en_US, sid_B92A8AAAF929593252B4E599579E07EE_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_helpfulnessAnswersFirst clientName_Lenovo compare products ?

Build quality is incredible. Much better than the w701DS I was lugging around. Screen is fantastic. Keyboard very nice feel. Easier than ever to install but part of that credit goes to Windows 10 which is much better at setting up devices. I loaded it with 64 Gig of memory to run multiple VM's at once. Seems up to the task so far. Put in a 2 gig SSD to hold the VM's. Easy install. I have the dock and I can report that the thunderbolt / type C ports are accessible and work as USB type C while docked. Very pleased. If it last as long as the W701ds, 5+ years, I'll be very happy. Date published: 2016-01-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by wrosing from Wow! I just received a P70. The speed of the system is noticeably better than my current W550s -- which is saying something. Open Gl and Autocad Inventor graphics shine. I am not sure this is the "Retro" machine people have been talking about. if it is, the moniker might be fun, but this is a great laptop. Admittedly it is a bit large and heavier than usual. But that is the point! It has plenty of ports, a DVD, capacity for a lot of RAM. The slightly larger keyboard happens to correspond with my normal workstation keyboard -- so much so touch typing feels totally familiar. I cannot accurately rate Reliability yet, but it did work out of the box. :) Date published: 2016-01-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by practical from Excellent performance, good feature set. A very powerful machine, generally well-designed for power users. PCI NVMe drives are outstanding and amazingly fast--boot times are astonishing. Memory capacity is up to snuff at up to 64 GM RAM. 4K screen is clear, sharp and excellent. Xeon iCPU s a great option. Large physical buttons for TrackPad and TrackPoint have returned and function very well. New keyboard design is comfortable and functional although not as elegant as the older Selectric-style keyboards of the original 17" workstation models. Wish an option for Bluray drive was available. Overall, I am very satisfied and highly recommend the P70. Those seeking to replace older ThinkPad workstations not have an excellent option.

The secondary SSD is too pricey. I'm confused on the number of hard drives I can add beyond the two SSD mentioned. What can I select and what can I add later? Asked by: jerry200 I purchased the P70 with 2 512gb SSDs (C: D:), and added 2 more 512gb HDD - one replaced the DVD tray. Then I purchased 2 Samsung 2TB Pro SSD, replaced the 512HDD and now I have 5TB SSD onboard. Yes, it added almost $2,000 to the already $7,200 cost of the laptop but it is really nice! No problems at all. Answered by: BobP Date published: 2016-04-01 Are the P70 Screens glossy or untiglage? Asked by: Dave Rider Not glossy, no reflection, I love mine Answered by: WJICS Date published: 2016-09-27 How is the heat dissipation on the Thinkpad 70 ??? I've never owned a larger laptop where the heat buildup didn't shut my laptops down or cause headaches elsewhere. No one ever mentions it in tech specs, what can I expect with this one???? Asked by: EdziufromGreenpoint Mine is shipping now. I read 20 online reviews before buying and they all made positive comments on the cooling.  Let you know in a week or two.  Answered by: CaliforniaConsumer Date published: 2016-09-21 W700 Questions - page 2 2016-10-16T08:31CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvqa, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasquestionsanswers, tq_97 loc_en_US, sid_B92A8AAAF929593252B4E599579E07EE_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_helpfulnessAnswersFirst clientName_Lenovo compare products

Rated 5 out of 5 by SteveCPA from Very nice Bought in December and delivered in January a few days ahead of schedule. Build quality is incredible. Much better than the w701DS I was lugging around. Screen is fantastic. Keyboard very nice feel. Easier than ever to install but part of that credit goes to Windows 10 which is much better at setting up devices. I loaded it with 64 Gig of memory to run multiple VM's at once. Seems up to the task so far. Put in a 2 gig SSD to hold the VM's. Easy install. I have the dock and I can report that the thunderbolt / type C ports are accessible and work as USB type C while docked. Very pleased. If it last as long as the W701ds, 5+ years, I'll be very happy. Date published: 2016-01-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by wrosing from Wow! I just received a P70. The speed of the system is noticeably better than my current W550s -- which is saying something. Open Gl and Autocad Inventor graphics shine. I am not sure this is the "Retro" machine people have been talking about. if it is, the moniker might be fun, but this is a great laptop. Admittedly it is a bit large and heavier than usual. But that is the point! It has plenty of ports, a DVD, capacity for a lot of RAM. The slightly larger keyboard happens to correspond with my normal workstation keyboard -- so much so touch typing feels totally familiar. I cannot accurately rate Reliability yet, but it did work out of the box. :) Date published: 2016-01-29 Rated 5 out of 5 by practical from Excellent performance, good feature set. A very powerful machine, generally well-designed for power users. PCI NVMe drives are outstanding and amazingly fast--boot times are astonishing. Memory capacity is up to snuff at up to 64 GM RAM. 4K screen is clear, sharp and excellent. Xeon iCPU s a great option. Large physical buttons for TrackPad and TrackPoint have returned and function very well. New keyboard design is comfortable and functional although not as elegant as the older Selectric-style keyboards of the original 17" workstation models. Wish an option for Bluray drive was available. Overall, I am very satisfied and highly recommend the P70. Those seeking to replace older ThinkPad workstations not have an excellent option.

I'm interested in the P70 with a SSD (512GB SSD PCIe-NVMe) primary. The secondary SSD is too pricey. I'm confused on the number of hard drives I can add beyond the two SSD mentioned. What can I select and what can I add later? Asked by: jerry200 I purchased the P70 with 2 512gb SSDs (C: D:), and added 2 more 512gb HDD - one replaced the DVD tray. Then I purchased 2 Samsung 2TB Pro SSD, replaced the 512HDD and now I have 5TB SSD onboard. Yes, it added almost $2,000 to the already $7,200 cost of the laptop but it is really nice! No problems at all. Answered by: BobP Date published: 2016-04-01 Are the P70 Screens glossy or untiglage? Asked by: Dave Rider Not glossy, no reflection, I love mine Answered by: WJICS Date published: 2016-09-27 How is the heat dissipation on the Thinkpad 70 ??? I've never owned a larger laptop where the heat buildup didn't shut my laptops down or cause headaches elsewhere. No one ever mentions it in tech specs, what can I expect with this one???? Asked by: EdziufromGreenpoint Mine is shipping now. I read 20 online reviews before buying and they all made positive comments on the cooling.  Let you know in a week or two.  Answered by: CaliforniaConsumer Date published: 2016-09-21 W700 Questions - page 2 2016-10-16T08:31CST bvseo_cps, prod_bvqa, vn_cps_3.4.0 cp_1, bvpage1 co_hasquestionsanswers, tq_97 loc_en_US, sid_B92A8AAAF929593252B4E599579E07EE_12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087, PRD, sort_helpfulnessAnswersFirst clientName_Lenovo
