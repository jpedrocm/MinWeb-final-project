The only problem I've really had is slow processing, but that's only when I have 9 of the 10 gigabytes available filled. It's got a nice solid frame, excellent battery life, and more memory then my gen1 moto X. Very satisfied with my purchase. Date published: 2016-07-25 Rated 3 out of 5 by Funkknot from Good buy for the money Overall, I'm happy with my Lenovo 110 that I bought a month ago. I needed something new that was simply a solid laptop/tablet to get online with, write, and manage my personal website. It does all that well. My one complaint is that - being a writer - the keyboard layout doesn't work well for someone accustomed to typing over 100 words a minute. The shift, tab and arrow keys are not where they normally are on most standard keyboards. I'm adjusting to it, but it has been really annoying adjusting to it. If you're not a writer, no worries. A solid laptop for the money. Without the keyboard layout problem, I would have rated this a 4 or 5. Date published: 2016-10-04 Rated 4 out of 5 by alecp98 from Great computer I bought this computer in the beginning of August for school, and it works great. It is capable of running a few applications at a time and is best suitable for using the internet. I did not use it for games, but assume it will work with a little lag. I do enjoy this product.

The only problem I've really had is slow processing, but that's only when I have 9 of the 10 gigabytes available filled. It's got a nice solid frame, excellent battery life, and more memory then my gen1 moto X. Very satisfied with my purchase. Date published: 2016-07-25 Rated 3 out of 5 by Funkknot from Good buy for the money Overall, I'm happy with my Lenovo 110 that I bought a month ago. I needed something new that was simply a solid laptop/tablet to get online with, write, and manage my personal website. It does all that well. My one complaint is that - being a writer - the keyboard layout doesn't work well for someone accustomed to typing over 100 words a minute. The shift, tab and arrow keys are not where they normally are on most standard keyboards. I'm adjusting to it, but it has been really annoying adjusting to it. If you're not a writer, no worries. A solid laptop for the money. Without the keyboard layout problem, I would have rated this a 4 or 5. Date published: 2016-10-04 Rated 4 out of 5 by alecp98 from Great computer I bought this computer in the beginning of August for school, and it works great. It is capable of running a few applications at a time and is best suitable for using the internet. I did not use it for games, but assume it will work with a little lag. I do enjoy this product.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Reaverian1816 from Solid craftsmanship, and excellent memory I've had this tablet for a month now, it's a very fine piece of technology. The only problem I've really had is slow processing, but that's only when I have 9 of the 10 gigabytes available filled. It's got a nice solid frame, excellent battery life, and more memory then my gen1 moto X. Very satisfied with my purchase. Date published: 2016-07-25 Rated 3 out of 5 by Funkknot from Good buy for the money Overall, I'm happy with my Lenovo 110 that I bought a month ago. I needed something new that was simply a solid laptop/tablet to get online with, write, and manage my personal website. It does all that well. My one complaint is that - being a writer - the keyboard layout doesn't work well for someone accustomed to typing over 100 words a minute. The shift, tab and arrow keys are not where they normally are on most standard keyboards. I'm adjusting to it, but it has been really annoying adjusting to it. If you're not a writer, no worries. A solid laptop for the money. Without the keyboard layout problem, I would have rated this a 4 or 5. Date published: 2016-10-04 Rated 4 out of 5 by alecp98 from Great computer I bought this computer in the beginning of August for school, and it works great. It is capable of running a few applications at a time and is best suitable for using the internet. I did not use it for games, but assume it will work with a little lag. I do enjoy this product.
