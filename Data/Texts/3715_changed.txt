Much superfluous software installed -- but you can say that for just about any vendor. Only real negatives are that it seems a bit sluggish for having 6GB of Ram installed, and there's no "desktop mode" or similar battery management option to accommodate the fact that the laptop might spend the majority of its life plugged in.

I have to remove the battery three different times to reset the laptop: it randomly shuts off: I, at one point, thought it was dead because it didn't boot up after a day, I checked all the connections, I even switched outlets: nothing. I let it go for a day, and it was fine. Unfortunately I cannot return this machine as it is past the return date from where it was bought.

By dolly from palmer,ma Comments about Toshiba 17.3" Satellite AMD Quad-Core Laptop Computer: this laptop is the best, the keyboard easy to use and see, the screen size perfect for a 60 year old don't always have to have reading glasses on, great for streaming videos ad movies.

Much superfluous software installed -- but you can say that for just about any vendor. Only real negatives are that it seems a bit sluggish for having 6GB of Ram installed, and there's no "desktop mode" or similar battery management option to accommodate the fact that the laptop might spend the majority of its life plugged in.

I have to remove the battery three different times to reset the laptop: it randomly shuts off: I, at one point, thought it was dead because it didn't boot up after a day, I checked all the connections, I even switched outlets: nothing. I let it go for a day, and it was fine. Unfortunately I cannot return this machine as it is past the return date from where it was bought.

8/19/2015   4.0 Worth the price By g13308 from Blossvale, NY Comments about Toshiba 17.3" Satellite AMD Quad-Core Laptop Computer: Overall a good value. Much superfluous software installed -- but you can say that for just about any vendor. Only real negatives are that it seems a bit sluggish for having 6GB of Ram installed, and there's no "desktop mode" or similar battery management option to accommodate the fact that the laptop might spend the majority of its life plugged in.

5/30/2015   2.0 frustrated By Kyoshimurata from ME Comments about Toshiba 17.3" Satellite AMD Quad-Core Laptop Computer: I have had this particular model for over 30 days, figures. I have to remove the battery three different times to reset the laptop: it randomly shuts off: I, at one point, thought it was dead because it didn't boot up after a day, I checked all the connections, I even switched outlets: nothing. I let it go for a day, and it was fine. Unfortunately I cannot return this machine as it is past the return date from where it was bought.
