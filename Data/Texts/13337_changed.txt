Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A ASUS X·SERIES Classic Design. Expressive Colors. Enjoy a World of Color ASUS X Series laptops can be specced up to a Full HD (1920x 1080) resolution display. With a pixel density of 141 pixels per inch (PPI), you'll enjoy rich detailed images onscreen. To ensure only the very best images, exclusive ASUS Splendid Technology has color temperature correction to reproduce richer, deeper colors. It features four visuals modes which can be accessed with a single click. Vivid Mode optimizes contrast for browsing photos or watching videos and movies; Eye Care Mode reduces blue light levels and is ideal when you're reading for long hours. Normal Mode has been tuned for daily tasks; while Manual Mode is for advanced color adjustments. Protect Your Eyes with ASUS Eye Care Most LED panels emit blue light - the main cause of macular degeneration and retinal problems. ASUS Eye Care mode effectively reduces blue light levels by 33% to make reading comfortable, and to protect you from potential eye fatigue and other ailments. Expressive colors. Stunning finishes. Designed for daily computing, the stylish ASUS X Series comes in 10 expressive colors and a variety of textured finishes to make sure you stand out from the crowd. It features an elegant Zen-inspired spun finish or a brushed finish for a premium metallic look and feel. ASUS X Series has garnered numerous design accolades, including a 2014 Good Design Award. Long-Lasting Polymer Battery ASUS X series laptops feature a Li-Polymer battery that gives you up to 800 charge cycles — 2.5 times the lifespan of standard Li-ion cylinder batteries. On top of that, a Li-Polymer battery retains up to 80% of its original charge capacity even after hundreds of charge cycles so you won't have to worry about deteriorating battery performance. Thanks to a clever combination of hardware and software optimization, the battery adheres to the highest battery safety standards and gives you optimal charging performance to prolong its lifespan. Short circuit Protection The battery automatically shuts off when the control board detects a short circuit. Cell TCO Protection The battery cell features Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCOs) to guard against overheating. Charge Protection The overcharge/discharge feature cuts off electric current when the battery is fully-charged or discharged. Temperature Protection Built-in sensors and control modules ensure the batteries operate within a safe temperature; it automatically stops charging when there's an abnormally high temperature. JEITA Protection The polymer battery provides a level of safety that surpasses industry standards; while the JEITA-compliant battery-temperature monitoring software provides an added level of safety and reliability. Uncompromising performance ASUS X Series features up to 6th-generation Intel® Core™ i7 processors to give you smooth and responsive computing performance. This processing performance, coupled with NVIDIA graphics, an advanced onboard memory controller, 12GB RAM, and Windows 10 make X Series ideal for daily computing. You can even choose up to 2TB HDD storage or upgrade to a solid-state disk (SSD) for faster data access. Windows 10 Home Ergonomic Keyboard Design Typing is now more comfortable than ever with the X Series’ full-size one-piece chiclet keyboard. An improved back-assembly provides 1.8mm of key travel and minimal key float, so you get a more solid typing feel. Intuitive ASUS Smart Gesture Input ASUS Smart Gesture technology utilizes an intelligent combination of hardware and software optimization to give you precise input. Sophisticated smartphone touchscreen production methods result in a highly sensitive touch pad that allows you to pinch-zoom in and out, or scroll through images and webpages with ease Charm Right Edge Swipe Left Edge Swipe Switch to Last App Webpage Scrolling Up and Down Zoom In / Out Two-Finger Pinch Larger and Smarter Touchpad The larger 106mm x 74mm touchpads found on the X Series have a palm rejection feature which differentiates between actual fingertip and palm contact to counter unintentional cursor movement. Stays Cool, Even After Hours of Use ASUS IceCool Technology gives X Series a unique internal design that addresses uncomfortable heating issues by preventing heat build-up under the palm rest. This keeps the palm rest surface between 28°C to 35°C – significantly lower than body temperature. This exclusive internal layout places heat producing components away from you, and when combined with exceptional cooling from the heat pipes and vents, ensures you stay comfortable even after long hours of use. Expansive Audio, Tuned by Experts A mixture of hardware, software, and tuning, SonicMaster was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. A professional codec ensures precise sound performance; while an optimized amplifier, larger speakers and resonance chambers deliver powerful audio output and deeper bass. Additional signal processing helps fine tune the hardware, filtering noise and improving clarity so you can enjoy unrivalled audio on your X Series. AudioWizard-Optimized Tuning AudioWizard helps you fine tune your audio through five pre-set modes. Its simple and intuitive interface lets you switch instantly between these modes to get the best audio for any content, in any environment. Or if you prefer, take full control of settings manually. Music mode brings your favorite songs to life, while Movie mode gives you cinema-quality audio. Recording mode optimizes settings so you get crystal-clear recording. Gaming mode fully immerses you in the game, while Speech mode ensures clearer dialogue. Designed for your convenience ASUS X Series gives you a wide array of connectivity options that include USB 3.0, HDMI and VGA ports, a 3-in-1 SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, and more to ensure compatibility with various peripherals and USB 3.0 delivers ten times the speed of USB 2.0, so you can transfer photos, music, and even large video files in a fraction of the time — transferring a 25GB Blu-ray qualivie takes a mere 70 seconds. ASUS WebStorage Each ASUS X Series laptop comes with 16GB of ASUS WebStorage space free for one year.  ASUS WebStorage gives you access to all your files as long as you are connected to the internet. Your files are synchronized between all your devices, so the most up-to-date versions are always on hand.

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A ASUS X·SERIES Classic Design. Expressive Colors. Enjoy a World of Color ASUS X Series laptops can be specced up to a Full HD (1920x 1080) resolution display. With a pixel density of 141 pixels per inch (PPI), you'll enjoy rich detailed images onscreen. To ensure only the very best images, exclusive ASUS Splendid Technology has color temperature correction to reproduce richer, deeper colors. It features four visuals modes which can be accessed with a single click. Vivid Mode optimizes contrast for browsing photos or watching videos and movies; Eye Care Mode reduces blue light levels and is ideal when you're reading for long hours. Normal Mode has been tuned for daily tasks; while Manual Mode is for advanced color adjustments. Protect Your Eyes with ASUS Eye Care Most LED panels emit blue light - the main cause of macular degeneration and retinal problems. ASUS Eye Care mode effectively reduces blue light levels by 33% to make reading comfortable, and to protect you from potential eye fatigue and other ailments. Expressive colors. Stunning finishes. Designed for daily computing, the stylish ASUS X Series comes in 10 expressive colors and a variety of textured finishes to make sure you stand out from the crowd. It features an elegant Zen-inspired spun finish or a brushed finish for a premium metallic look and feel. ASUS X Series has garnered numerous design accolades, including a 2014 Good Design Award. Long-Lasting Polymer Battery ASUS X series laptops feature a Li-Polymer battery that gives you up to 800 charge cycles — 2.5 times the lifespan of standard Li-ion cylinder batteries. On top of that, a Li-Polymer battery retains up to 80% of its original charge capacity even after hundreds of charge cycles so you won't have to worry about deteriorating battery performance. Thanks to a clever combination of hardware and software optimization, the battery adheres to the highest battery safety standards and gives you optimal charging performance to prolong its lifespan. Short circuit Protection The battery automatically shuts off when the control board detects a short circuit. Cell TCO Protection The battery cell features Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCOs) to guard against overheating. Charge Protection The overcharge/discharge feature cuts off electric current when the battery is fully-charged or discharged. Temperature Protection Built-in sensors and control modules ensure the batteries operate within a safe temperature; it automatically stops charging when there's an abnormally high temperature. JEITA Protection The polymer battery provides a level of safety that surpasses industry standards; while the JEITA-compliant battery-temperature monitoring software provides an added level of safety and reliability. Uncompromising performance ASUS X Series features up to 6th-generation Intel® Core™ i7 processors to give you smooth and responsive computing performance. This processing performance, coupled with NVIDIA graphics, an advanced onboard memory controller, 12GB RAM, and Windows 10 make X Series ideal for daily computing. You can even choose up to 2TB HDD storage or upgrade to a solid-state disk (SSD) for faster data access. Windows 10 Home Ergonomic Keyboard Design Typing is now more comfortable than ever with the X Series’ full-size one-piece chiclet keyboard. An improved back-assembly provides 1.8mm of key travel and minimal key float, so you get a more solid typing feel. Intuitive ASUS Smart Gesture Input ASUS Smart Gesture technology utilizes an intelligent combination of hardware and software optimization to give you precise input. Sophisticated smartphone touchscreen production methods result in a highly sensitive touch pad that allows you to pinch-zoom in and out, or scroll through images and webpages with ease Charm Right Edge Swipe Left Edge Swipe Switch to Last App Webpage Scrolling Up and Down Zoom In / Out Two-Finger Pinch Larger and Smarter Touchpad The larger 106mm x 74mm touchpads found on the X Series have a palm rejection feature which differentiates between actual fingertip and palm contact to counter unintentional cursor movement. Stays Cool, Even After Hours of Use ASUS IceCool Technology gives X Series a unique internal design that addresses uncomfortable heating issues by preventing heat build-up under the palm rest. This keeps the palm rest surface between 28°C to 35°C – significantly lower than body temperature. This exclusive internal layout places heat producing components away from you, and when combined with exceptional cooling from the heat pipes and vents, ensures you stay comfortable even after long hours of use. Expansive Audio, Tuned by Experts A mixture of hardware, software, and tuning, SonicMaster was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. A professional codec ensures precise sound performance; while an optimized amplifier, larger speakers and resonance chambers deliver powerful audio output and deeper bass. Additional signal processing helps fine tune the hardware, filtering noise and improving clarity so you can enjoy unrivalled audio on your X Series. AudioWizard-Optimized Tuning AudioWizard helps you fine tune your audio through five pre-set modes. Its simple and intuitive interface lets you switch instantly between these modes to get the best audio for any content, in any environment. Or if you prefer, take full control of settings manually. Music mode brings your favorite songs to life, while Movie mode gives you cinema-quality audio. Recording mode optimizes settings so you get crystal-clear recording. Gaming mode fully immerses you in the game, while Speech mode ensures clearer dialogue. Designed for your convenience ASUS X Series gives you a wide array of connectivity options that include USB 3.0, HDMI and VGA ports, a 3-in-1 SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, and more to ensure compatibility with various peripherals and USB 3.0 delivers ten times the speed of USB 2.0, so you can transfer photos, music, and even large video files in a fraction of the time — transferring a 25GB Blu-ray qualivie takes a mere 70 seconds.

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A ASUS X·SERIES Classic Design. Expressive Colors. Enjoy a World of Color ASUS X Series laptops can be specced up to a Full HD (1920x 1080) resolution display. With a pixel density of 141 pixels per inch (PPI), you'll enjoy rich detailed images onscreen. To ensure only the very best images, exclusive ASUS Splendid Technology has color temperature correction to reproduce richer, deeper colors.

Vivid Mode optimizes contrast for browsing photos or watching videos and movies; Eye Care Mode reduces blue light levels and is ideal when you're reading for long hours. Normal Mode has been tuned for daily tasks; while Manual Mode is for advanced color adjustments. Protect Your Eyes with ASUS Eye Care Most LED panels emit blue light - the main cause of macular degeneration and retinal problems. ASUS Eye Care mode effectively reduces blue light levels by 33% to make reading comfortable, and to protect you from potential eye fatigue and other ailments. Expressive colors. Stunning finishes. Designed for daily computing, the stylish ASUS X Series comes in 10 expressive colors and a variety of textured finishes to make sure you stand out from the crowd. It features an elegant Zen-inspired spun finish or a brushed finish for a premium metallic look and feel. ASUS X Series has garnered numerous design accolades, including a 2014 Good Design Award. Long-Lasting Polymer Battery ASUS X series laptops feature a Li-Polymer battery that gives you up to 800 charge cycles — 2.5 times the lifespan of standard Li-ion cylinder batteries. On top of that, a Li-Polymer battery retains up to 80% of its original charge capacity even after hundreds of charge cycles so you won't have to worry about deteriorating battery performance. Thanks to a clever combination of hardware and software optimization, the battery adheres to the highest battery safety standards and gives you optimal charging performance to prolong its lifespan. Short circuit Protection The battery automatically shuts off when the control board detects a short circuit. Cell TCO Protection The battery cell features Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCOs) to guard against overheating.

Stays Cool, Even After Hours of Use ASUS IceCool Technology gives X Series a unique internal design that addresses uncomfortable heating issues by preventing heat build-up under the palm rest. This keeps the palm rest surface between 28°C to 35°C – significantly lower than body temperature. This exclusive internal layout places heat producing components away from you, and when combined with exceptional cooling from the heat pipes and vents, ensures you stay comfortable even after long hours of use. Expansive Audio, Tuned by Experts A mixture of hardware, software, and tuning, SonicMaster was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. A professional codec ensures precise sound performance; while an optimized amplifier, larger speakers and resonance chambers deliver powerful audio output and deeper bass.
