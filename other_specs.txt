That's exactly what I thought	
I didn't want the baby to catch a cold, so I closed the window	
Yes, that was fun	
How long do I have to stay here?	
I was about to leave the restaurant when my friends arrived	
I told him to leave the room	
I don't like him	
He will get nowhere with his plans	
She returned his kiss	
I'm a little hungry	
Tom hasn't finished all his homework yet	
My son is taller than I am	
The lake is deepest at this point	
What's your native language?	
He owns this land	
Try to say it	
I think it's time for me to do my homework	
I saw Tom play tennis	
I like French food very much	
Put your hat on	
I'm able to ski	
Don't stand up	
Take anything you want	
I have a computer	
I got this book from him	
Tom always finds fault with her	
I have seen her before	
Yes, I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston	
I should not have said that	
She advised him to take the medicine	
I hurt my elbow	
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends	
We still have a lot of food left	
Tom can't play tennis	
There was a sudden change in the weather	
I want to see the movie	
Your answer is wrong	
No I didn't hear that Are you sure?	
We should spend our time creating content for our website rather than wasting time worrying about minor cosmetic details	
My uncle runs a hotel	
She used to hate him	
I felt a sudden pain in my side	
I am not getting involved	
I will play tennis this afternoon	
How long will you be staying?	
She advised him to keep his promises	
He made me a box yesterday	
Tom told her that he had written that poem two yearsitten that poem two years before	
It won't take so long	
What should I take first?	
You have the choice of soup or salad	
I can't believe that you actually got into Harvard	
Excuse me for opening your letter by mistake	
It has become much warmer	
She's older than me	
I would rather starve than steal	
I always take a bath before going to bed	
He seems unable to swim	
We lost our electricity because of the storm	
Paul wasn't with Mary when her purse was stolen	
It's awfully cold today	
My brother and I are getting together for dinner Do you want to come with us?	
Eleven o'clock is good for me	
I may have hurt his feelings	
He devoted his life to his study	
Wait till six	
Come upstairs	
Could you do this instead of me?	
I didn't know you were such a good cook	
I looked in my closet for something to wear	
He reminds me of my grandfather	
Don't cry	
Where is my watch?	
I've met that girl before	
Is your father a doctor?	
I have three children, two girls and one boy	
I can't remember his name	
No, I need to go get my car fixed this afternoon	
I am about to leave here	
The couple next door are fighting again	
She had a basket full of apples	
Don't worry, we can go tomorrow morning It opens at 8:00	
All's well that ends well	
The faster we rub our hands together, the warmer they get	
She has flowers in her hand	
I know, they look very similar	
What did you do then?	
She couldn't look him in the face	
Do you want anything to eat?	
Dick got in a traffic accident	
Will you glance through this report?	
Give me a break!	
Let's go to a concert together	
The island is warm all the year	
He's been waiting here for quite a while	
We're in a hurry	
I am not a morning person	
I had my watch repaired	
I've put on weight recently	
Would you mind lending me your car?	
We are his sons	
He finally realized that Mary had made a fool of him	
She was busy with housework	
I think it's time for me to say what I really think	
There is a good chance that he will win	
I'm not sure about that It took me about 3 months to find a job I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites
He is still very much alive	
That sounds really nice What did you do there?	
Pork doesn't agree with me	
I've heard Texas is a beautiful place	
Plastic does not burn easily	
He helped me move	
I told the story to anyone who would listen	
Keep out	
I think it's time for me to close the window	
Fancy meeting you here	
He must be tired	
I arrived in London	
It's close to ten o'clock It's about time we went to bed	
Are you proud of your father?	
I checked my briefcase and umbrella in the cloakroom	
How do I get to the American Embassy?	
She kissed him on the forehead	
Do you know if she can speak English?	
Can you tell me how to get to the station?	
This video is boring	
He's a little taller than you are	
He is acting on his own behalf	
Where is he?	
It rained all day yesterday	
I need to buy new skis	
Tom runs very fast	
I'll bet you that you're wrong about that	
Who buried the gold bars here?	
We want something new	
My sister's son Jimmy is my favorite nephew	
She quit the company	
The class begins at 8:30	
I got a new camera	
Is it all right to eat out tonight?	
I will gladly help you	
It pays to be polite	
Colds are contagious	
The police arrested the suspect	
Yes, that's right That's very good	
This rule doesn't apply to first-year students	
This makes no sense	
I seem to have misplaced my key last night	
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive	
I'll take the yellow one

I have always fed my dog the dog food that comes in the big green bag	
I could hardly understand him	
We traveled on foot	
My father loves pizza	
My uncle gave me his car	
May I have your name and address?	
He wondered why she did that	
She used to enjoy being with him	
Children often ask me for money	
Tom took off his clothes and put on his pajamas	
I haven't heard anything from him since then I wonder what in the world he's doing	
OK	
They each received a present

I don't feed my dog in the morning	
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you

I'd like you to look after my dog	
Turn off the gas	
The boy adjusted his cap	
Good luck	
I don't need an explanation	
I don't know that	
Tom doesn't really talk about his problems much	
I can't figure out what he really wants	
Tom doesn't have a bicycle	
Give me five days	
She looked around	
He wants something cold to drink	
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India	
I'd appreciate it if you would turn off the lights	
It's really hot there	
I studied for one hour	
That way	
It was three weeks before she wrote an answer to Tom	
I give up No matter what I do, you never seem to be satisfied	
Tom managed a small bar near Boston for quite a few years	
Nothing can force me to give it up	
Turn down the volume, please	
Take a taxi to the hotel	
He was deserted by his friends	
Please show me another	
I am not concerned with this	
We had a birthday party for the old lady	
I don't know the reason he is absent today	
We are about to leave here	
The question is who will do it

I'll have a bottle of water please	
You can't be serious	
He has no interest in politics	
I think Tom and Mary are secretly married

There is an exception to every rule	
Has Flight 123 arrived?	
I agree with them that we should try again	
He was robbed when coming home late at night	
I know It was a really good deal

He plays golf two or three times a month	
Hi Tina, It's Joe	
She advised him to take the medicine	
As soon as she opened the door, a cat ran out	
I shouldn't have done that I'm sorry	
They must have known it all along	
Do you think tomorrow will be a nice day?	
I found it difficult to keep a diary every day	
Let me see Yes, that one still has seats available Would you like me to reserve a seat for you?	
She is able to skate	
There are some books on the table	
I'm tired of him bawling me out	
Oh, that goes in the refrigerator

Tom lost his job	
It may possibly be fine tomorrow	
Rome wasn't built in a day

Try us again next Monday	
She used to help him with his homework	
I had my wallet stolen from my inner pocket	
He is a writer	
We don't like violence	
A little	
You were late, weren't you?	
She's getting breakfast ready	
It's ten o'clock sharp	
She complained to him about the food	
I'm ready to start	
He went fishing instead of playing tennis	
I think I'm losing my mind	
Did you see anybody there?	
Don't release that dog	
I like white roses better than red ones	
She has never visited him	
This is very important Don't forget	
How many nights will you be staying?	
Do you know us?	
She wasn't able to contact him by phone	
Where are the showers?	
I admire your courage	
Sorry, I didn't hear clearly	
Wouldn't you rather spend your time doing something you enjoy?	
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India	
They didn't tell me so	
Where are you going?	
Eat whatever food you like	
My cell phone doesn't work	
Did you get your wish?	
Mary took out the eggs one by one	
I'm single	
Sure	
I gave in to her demands	
What do you want to buy?	
Two men wearing ski masks entered the bank	
That's cheap, isn't it?	
You must pay attention to him	
Nobody was listening to the speech	
I think it's time for me to consult a doctor	
I think it's time for me to ask for his advice	
I ordered two hamburgers	
I am afraid I ate something bad

If I were you, I would trust her	
I think it's time for me to throw a little party	
Where is the registrar's office?	
Laptop Did I pronounce that correctly?	
She looked at him and knew that he was angry	
Her eyes were red from crying	
There is an urgent need for volunteers	
He fed his dog at the same time every day	
Do you have much money with you?	
You keep out of this	
She acted as if she didn't care what happened	
Let's begin at the beginning	
OK Let me look at your throat Open your mouth Your throat's red Does it hurt?	
How are you?	
My family isn't such a big family	
Why are you crying?	
I've never seen that before	
How was your afternoon?	
He was fast asleep	
Close your eyes	
He's almost as tall as me	
She's older than Tom

I want to emphasize this point in particular	
The engine doesn't work	
I can't make out what she said	
Fill it up, please	
Will you drive me home?	
Would you like to come with me?	
I sat down next to him	
Give me a call

What do you mean? I thought you said we were going shopping	
Mary loses her temper easily	
What's the address?	
I can't speak English at all	
The baby seemed to be fast asleep	
How much does it cost per day?	
He swims better than I do	
What kind of music is it?	
I left the rest to him and went out	
Roll the ball to me	
I think it's time for me to buy my son a car	
It isn't easy to write a love letter in English	
He bought his son a camera	
Here is your salad	
Do you know how to cook?	
She accompanied me on the piano	
The more time you spend talking about what you do, the less time you have to do it	
It's really hot there	
Will feeding my dog garlic cause any problems?	
They had to change their schedule because the train arrived late	
I played tennis	
Where do you live?	
I caught him stealing the money	
She has attractive eyes	
She's about the same age as me	
I'm dying for a cold drink	
Please write down your contact address here?	
For your own safety, never ride in a car with a drunk driver	
Everybody knows that	
Could I get one more beer, please?	
She taught us singing	
I sometimes feel drowsy in the early afternoon	
The baby was fast asleep in her mother's arms	
A good cook doesn't throw out yesterday's soup	
I think you need to think about the future	
I could hardly understand him	
OK	
All we can do is wait for the police to arrive	
That's cheap	
Yes, there's one here It's in the store	
She was almost hit by a car	
He's a little taller than you are	
I translated the poem the best I could	
He is kind	
Rome is in Italy	
We'll have to camp out if we can't find a place to stay	
Wow! That looks delicious	
How's the weather?	
Hi Joe	
Tom's a beginner, but he catches on fast	
The car is very fast	
She looked at him with a smile on her face	
He is unmarried	
I wish I could go to Japan	
Please say hello to her if you see her at the party	
I don't know when, but it'll happen someday	
I can't make out what she said	
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?	
He couldn't get the job	
This bicycle belongs to my brother	
Do you have any day tours?	
Which is better, the spaghetti or chicken salad?	
Please write down what he says	
We want something new	
What is over there?	
I'll show you around the city	
Don't let him touch it	
The doorbell rang	
They insisted on my getting the work done by tomorrow	
I've never seen a whale that big	
I got acquainted with her in France	
You can't trust anything he says	
Is this your first time in Japan?	
This table isn't steady	
He's not in	
May I ask a couple of questions?	
I have a nice present to give you	
He ran as fast as his legs could carry him	
My mother died two years ago	
For some reason, I'm wide awake and can't fall asleep	
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends	
She doesn't want him to go to Boston	
Nancy seldom smiles	
I haven't met him before	
She has a cold and is absent from school	
If you like it I can buy more	
Don't make fun of people	
Bob must have had an accident	
Make your airplane reservations early since flights fill up quickly around Christmas

Sure	
Please limit your presentation to 30 minutes	
Really? You don't have a license? I thought everyone had a license	
I wish I didn't have to work	
Don't let the dog in	
Wait a moment	
How do you say it in English?	
What's your last name?	
What do you think of this plan?	
More than six years	
I got up at six-thirty this morning	
Have you eaten lunch yet?

Tom attempted to persuade Mary to go to church with him	
My father is tall

She made him rich	
That's not a pencil That's a pen	
The room was warm	
I tried hard to make them stay home, but they refused to listen to me	
She is too young to know the truth	
I expect that he will help us	
I'm glad that you can come	
OK, are you driving?	
No, she's at school	
What's his most recent novel?	
He is about thirty	
No, they're still together	
She likes oranges	
She was only too glad to help us	
She treated him very well	
I shouldn't have to go to the dentist again for a while	
That sounds good, but I'm not sure how long I could do that

I think it's a shame that some foreign language teachers were able to graduate from college without ever having studied with a native speaker	
I gave him my address	
Do you know what he has done?	
I would like to attend the party on November 1st	
Tom can't taste the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine	
She picked him up at the station	
He had just arrived	
The sky brightened	
She used to enjoy being with him	
It's hot today, isn't it?	
Oh yes, it's almost Christmas, isn't it I'm not sure what I'll be doing then	
I would like to drastically decrease the amount of time it takes me to clean the house

I have to buy a new carpet for this room

I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me	
We had a very hot summer this year	
I'm looking for a sweater

Tom never fails to send a birthday present to his father	
This word comes from Greek

It costs 20 dollars per hour	
Don't drink and drive	
He named his son Robert after his own father	
That's the house where Tom was born	
I have a slight pain in my side	
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer	
I refuse to be ignored any longer	
She didn't want him to pamper the children	
Ken must be home by now	
When a child, I used to go fishing with him	
Nothing special, just working Why do you ask?	
Do you plan to go abroad?	
He came in just as I was going out	
Are you busy?	
Tom is one of Mary's neighbors

Tom set me up	
Is it hot?	
I expect her to pass the examination easily	
I can't believe you turned down that job	
Could you call again later please?	
Her car broke down on the way	
He caught the first train and got there just in time	
I can't stand this pain	
Beware of the dog!	
That is a pencil	
She wouldn't give him the time of day	
She has him under her thumb	
It's been a week, but I'm still suffering from jet lag	
He was holding a pen in his hand	
No, he's still sleeping	
I know, I didn't have time to put things away before you got here	
He is kind	
I'm afraid I have to go now	
She became a nurse	
I didn't want to spend any more time alone	
We plan to climb that mountain

I agree with you	
No, I'm OK We're late so we'd better not stop	
Please air the room	
I can't sing as well as Mary did	
She looked around	
She doesn't pay much attention to how she dresses	
He is still here	
I regarded Tom as a friend	
It might be my cell phone, I don't think I have very good reception	
It's for my personal use	
Do you know what he said?	
Tom is rarely late	
Please add my name to the list	
Is Steve with you?	
Are you serious? Why did you do that? I could have picked you up

He remained silent

He acts as if he were a king
